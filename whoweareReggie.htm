								<span style="font-size: 11pt">My initial inspiration to become a Teaching 
								Artist came form my work as an acting instructor 
								for Dream West, a program for at-risk children 
								in the West Oakland area of Northern 
								California.&nbsp;&nbsp; The acting workshop would 
								culminate with a performance of scenes and 
								vignettes written by myself, other staff 
								members, as well as the students.&nbsp; At the time, 
								I was in college earning duel degrees in 
								Dramatic Art and Communications at the 
								University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp; For three 
								years, I would look forward to this summer job, 
								as it was both a challenging and rewarding 
								experience.&nbsp; It was in this job that I first 
								realized that not only did I enjoy teaching 
								youth, but I also became aware of the fact that 
								sharing my skills and life experiences with the 
								young artists was very appealing to me.&nbsp; As they 
								would often come to watch me acting in 
								productions on campus, these students not only 
								got to know me as their theater instructor, but 
								they also got to see me in action, on stage in 
								various productions.&nbsp; I realized that this type 
								of working relationship, over the years, was 
								very effective on how my students viewed me in 
								relation to the craft of acting.&nbsp; My students 
								saw me as an individual who was not only their 
								instructor, but also a role model who was 
								actively pursuing my goals in the area of arts 
								that I happened to be teaching.</span></font></p>

								<span style="font-size: 11pt">While in college, I also met Dr. Margaret B. 
								Wilkerson, a woman who influenced and enriched 
								my interest in not only the arts, but she also 
								piqued my curiosity in the possibility of 
								becoming a Teaching Artist.&nbsp; Dr. Wilkerson, who 
								was head of the African American Studies 
								Department at Berkeley, was not only my 
								professor in several acting courses, but she 
								directed two productions that I acted in and 
								co-wrote, during my undergraduate career.&nbsp; Dr. 
								Wilkerson became my mentor, but moreover she was 
								also the key player in my realizing that the 
								work I did as an aspiring actor and a developing 
								playwright was important.&nbsp; She served as a prime 
								example that one could work in education, while 
								continuing to work as a successful artist.&nbsp; 
								Today Dr. Wilkerson serves as serves as Director 
								of Media, Arts and Culture at the Ford 
								Foundation.&nbsp; She still provides guidance and 
								mentorship in my life as an artist, as well as 
								career advice as an art educator.</span></font></p>

								enough to be open and free in their work.&nbsp; The 
								ultimate goal is that they contribute ideas in 
								class discussions and create projects, without 
								the fear of judgment or harsh criticism.&nbsp; That 
								said, as an art instructor, I feel that it is 
								also important to develop the talent to impart 
								constructive criticism without stifling the 
								creativity of your students. A betrayal of trust 
								and respect in the culture of a classroom, that 
								the instructor and students have established, 
								can destroy the sense of candor that you have 
								all worked so hard to develop.&nbsp; I usually start 
								the year by coming up with a list of ground 
								rules for the class.&nbsp; These ground rules are 
								generated from the class in a group discussion.&nbsp; 
								The list is then clarified and agreed upon by 
								the group.&nbsp; The students, instructor and 
								teaching assistants, then sign the ground rules, 
								as a written contract.&nbsp; I have found that this 
								process helps establish an environment in which 
								students can be creative and honest, with some 
								form of established structure.</span></font></p>

								<span style="font-size: 11pt">It might sound a bit cliché, but in my many 
								years of teaching, I have found that an art 
								instructor can learn just as much from his or 
								her students as they learn from the instructor.&nbsp; 
								As an artist and as an instructor, you never 
								stop growing and learning new lessons. Because 
								they have their fingers on the pulse of 
								important issues that face our society today, my 
								young students often keep me informed on the 
								relevant issues that they grapple with both 
								locally and globally.&nbsp; Astonishingly, it is 
								often these same issues that I decide to explore 
								in my own work.&nbsp; The insight of my students is 
								often very candid and crystal clear.&nbsp; Their 
								opinions are very definitive, with little or no 
								gray areas.&nbsp; Their viewpoints on societal norms 
								that baffle many adults are not overly affected 
								with conjecture based on the fear of how they 
								might be perceived by their peers.&nbsp; As 
								educators, especially in the arts, we need to 
								acknowledge the viewpoints and opinions of our 
								youth.&nbsp; </span></font> </p>

								Artist needs to be able to find a balance 
								between his or her work as an artist and his/her 
								job as an art educator.&nbsp; Time management is key 
								to success in both areas.&nbsp; The Teaching Artist 
								is essentially balancing two careers, one as an 
								artist and the other as an educator. &nbsp;In the 
								event, it is so easy to neglect one for the 
								other.&nbsp; When I take on a job, I strive to commit 
								myself wholeheartedly to that position.&nbsp; I have 
								found it essential to set aside a few hours each 
								day to focus on my work as an artist, as it is 
								so easy to fall into the trap of focusing all of 
								my time on planning and preparation for my 
								classes.&nbsp; Total neglect for one or the other, 
								can result in an individual feeling frustrated 
								or unfulfilled.&nbsp; So to avoid this common 
								pitfall, I consciously put myself on a weekly,

								<span style="font-size: 11pt">Financially, working as a freelance artist and 
								filmmaker, coupled with my work as a teacher 
								with both CAP and LAUSD, have afforded me to 
								make a living as a Teaching Artist.&nbsp; However, 
								the greater motivating factor that has sustained 
								my interest in working in arts education is 
								derived from the fact that one’s work is never 
								done.&nbsp; There is always another young mind that I 
								can influence, through my work as an artist, or 
								through a lesson that I impart to one of my 
								students as their instructor.&nbsp; Through my work 
								in the classroom, I, like my students, continue 
								to learn and grow.&nbsp; Thus, a healthy symbiotic 
								relationship is created that never ceases to 
								affect me as a teacher, and influences me as an 
								artist.</span></font></p>
