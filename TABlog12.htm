<h3><span style="font-size: 11pt">Blog from artist Sarah Haskell, York, ME</span></h3>
							<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It is Monday morning August 21, 2006. I am waiting for the 
opening session of the Lesley University and NECAP (New England Consortium of 
Artist Educator Professionals) Institute for Teaching Artists. Back in January 
2006, I joined a &nbsp;small group of teaching artists (TAs)and&nbsp; arts administrators 
to plan this two day institute that will bring together teaching artists from 
the six New England states. The brainchild of David Marshall (MCC/MA Cultural 
Council), this project grew from an initial conversation to a formal partnership 
between Lesley University and NECAP. </span> </p>
											</span>
							<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Let me introduce myself. I am a teaching artist from Maine, 
a founding member of NECAP and one of the planners of this institute. I am 
delighted to bring you into the workshops, the presentations, the small group 
discussions and the lunch time dialogues that will transpire over the next two 
days. As I scan the room looking at the 75 or so attendees, I am pleased to see 
that we are not all grey haired. There is young blood here, and that is 
heartwarming!</span></p>
											</span>
							<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">The conference opened with words from Mary Kelly, exec. 
Director of MCC, Martha McKenna, Provost Lesley Univ., and Lisa Donovan, 
Dir. of Creative Arts ED. Lesley University.&nbsp; All three agreed that this new 
initiative is sorely needed and delivered inspiring words to kick off the 
institute. I particularly appreciated the reminder that “</span><b><i><span style="font-size: 11pt">making art is the 
foundation to our teaching”.</span></i></b></p>

The Field: What is a Profession Teaching Artist?<br>
<br>
</b>Sherry Brown, RI State Arts Council on the 
Arts, highlighted the background and mission of NECAP (New England Consortium of 
Artist Educator Professionals). This NE regional organization began 6 yrs ago on 
a back porch in NH. NECAP recognizes and promotes the professional field of the 
teaching artist; and encourages professional development for these educators. 
Collaborating with the NE State Arts Agencies, other organizations, and 
individuals NECAP works to advance:&nbsp; the field of the artist-educator, a 
regional network, and access to quality professional development and community 
of artist-educators.</span></p>

<p>John is an energetic presenter

seminar:</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"></p>

	the universal”&nbsp; </span></font> </li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Be aware of the undercurrent of things going on in any 
	residency, the unspoken foundation for the work. Knowledge of this 
	foundation will guide many decisions</span></font></li>

</ul>
							<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">John states that he now has limits to his work; he will 
engage only in year long partnerships. A commitment and trust is developed with 
this arrangement, with the possibility that a multi year partnership will 
develop. </span> </p>
											</span>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Human minds remember beginnings and endings. Frame the 
	residency with a good opening and a powerful closing. </span></font> </li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">At the initial meeting be clear that a residency 
	cannot have both a breadth (reach every kid) or a depth experience. As TAs 
	we must know where to draw the line, in regards to size of groups, and 
	number of groups per day. Let your partner know how each change will affect 
	the common goal.</span></font></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Be clear about what you as a TA want to do. This will 
	help you define your limits.</span></font></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The final product needs to be appropriate to age 
	group, to the subject at hand. Not really important what the product is, 
	from an opening, a rehearsal, readings, or production. </span></font> </li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Initial meeting: Know what you want and what you are 
	willing to do. Make sure that all key players are at the meeting. Who is 
	already involved with your medium, knows the value, and there is no need to 
	“sell the work”. Start where the interest is, the buzz from this small group 
	will grow beyond this initial group. </span></font> </li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Limit yourself to what you can do well. 
	</span></font> </li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Be generous at the beginning, be a bit flexible. It 
	will pay off in the long run. Don’t over extend your self…but how can you go 
	a bit more than the usual.</span></font></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Trust your inner voice, your intuition. If the initial 
	meeting brings up things, speak up. This will begin the project with a 
	foundation of truth and honest communication. Be brave and open. Model 
	courage, the courage to speak up, the courage to stand your ground with what 
	you know works, your limits. The seed of all art is in courage. This means 
	you care enough, but know how to channel this energy.</span></font></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><b><span style="font-size: 11pt">Menu of Possibilities (Services)</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt"> have a variety 
	of ways to deliver this menu. Written, spoken, on a board, photos. Point out 
	any time that you use MI. multiple intelligences.</span></font></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">A good teacher will be one step ahead of the students 
	in knowing the “temperature” of the group….improvisation is essential. Don’t 
	really assume that you really know where they are; ask them, this can be 
	interesting info, not to put them on the spot, but to grow the work. This 
	will change the dynamic in the room…check in with the group. Stop the class, 
	take a break, and challenge the class to solve the problem together. Keep 
	trying ideas. Growing, ask for help. Do not take disruptive behavior 
	personally. &nbsp;</span></font></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Meeting with teachers, be very clear with your needs, 
	and that they need to participate from the beginning. Ask teacher to be in 
	charge of discipline. Check in back and forth, create a dialogue with the 
	teacher. &nbsp;</span></font></li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Listen to teachers, value their time, thoughts, 
	deconstruct why the teachers are angry or resistant. </span></font> </li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Assessment and evaluation need to be considered from 
	the beginning. Start with asking the question:&nbsp; How will we know if we are 
	doing a good job? This will create the rubric for the project. Know the 
	difference between assessment (what happened?) and evaluation (what do we 
	think about what happened?). &nbsp;How do we know if the work is good?&nbsp; 
	</span></font> </li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Assessment/evaluation: Can start with the students. 
	Present the goals to student. Are these reachable? How will we know if we 
	have reached these goals? From the very beginning examine how we will 
	measure our progress.</span></font></li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discussion to

									<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">
<p class="MsoNormal">These steps are about viewing art making. 
Building future audiences, because most students will be the audience in the

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Standards: You need to have a basic knowledge of the

	at the initial meeting. </span></font> </li>
	<li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Goals and outcomes: KEEP IT SIMPLE.One or two goals 
	are fine. You can throw in goals as you progress thru the residency. Involve

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.0pt"><span style="font-size: 11pt">At the end of John’s 
presentation, I had a huge AH-HA! This work is not about ME. I realized that 
this work is about creating a dialogue with my students, the teachers, and the 
community; to grow together through the arts. I come into a school to help the 
community grow thru the arts, I am the expert in my art form, and must stand my 
ground as to what I know will work. I have experience, yet will value their 
input in the journey. That in a nutshell is what I came to know from this 
seminar.</span></p>

after-school community art program</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">RAW ART WORKS: RAW began in 1988 with a long range 
commitment to the community. This program for inner city teenagers focuses on 
“No mistakes, just Art”, </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">How to transform blech into beauty, and treasures from 
trash. Kids builds self esteem, build community and get exposure to a variety of 
art techniques and good materials. Character building is a big part of the 
program, creating respect for each other, adults the routine and the community.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Four goals at RAW that guide all works with all ages:</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">1. Use the arts to address identity</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">2. Belonging: how do we create a sense of belonging, and a 
safe place?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">3. Success: how do we create opportunities for success?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">4. Reach out to the greater community: expose the arts, 
give voice in the community</span></font></p>

											</span>
											</span>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Berta (classroom teacher): a visiting artist brings 
a perspective form the outside world, fresh perspective with respect for the 
students. Opened up a door that is hard to open alone as a teacher. The artist 
and the teacher had a different point of view for the project, teacher is 
crucial. Time/schedule is ultimate. Show up! Be on time! </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Robert (TA): Relationship with the school is very 
important. A long term relationship is rich with small detail and growth. TAs 
are changing the way education is seen, upending the curriculum, giving students 
the opportunity to wrestle with intellectual issues. Artists provide the 
students with the opportunity to sit talk, explore, and diverge from the normal 
classroom manner. What we learn from students and bring back to teachers and 
principals is the nugget of the work. Valuable conversation with teachers…what 
we see is often very different.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Lourdes (Principal): Relationships are the most 
important. Teachers that challenge are good; pushing the boundaries. 
Communication is crucial. Using arts to supplement learning within a multi 
language schools. Schools are under tremendous pressure with state standards and 
testing. Build relationships with any school, find what the vision is, what is 
motivating the decision that the school is making. What is the curriculum? What 
are the beliefs? What is the school climate, culture? What do you want the 
teachers to gain from this experience? Teachers can be very resistant. Bring 
them in, don’t let them sit, invite them in to share the work, help the kids. 
Give principals a chance, invite them into the dialogue. Befriend the secretary, 
custodian, and teacher’s aides. Don’t give up on the principals!</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Kit (community arts administrator): Go straight to 
the mission of the organization and weave the art work into that. Balance is 
very important; the artist brings a structure and has flexibility. Establish 
your own way as an artist, with a sense of boundaries with a respect for the 
students. Model that there are no mistakes, let go of structure, lesson changes, 
and work thru the challenges, laughter is important. Listen in the beginning, to 
the tone of the room, be right in the moment. What can you leave with the 
teacher? Staff can take what you offer and use it in the future to grow the 
programs. Be a role model. Deal with the unexpected, find delight in the 
frustration. </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Savannah (film making student from RAW): 
Demonstrated the success of the RAW program by her self esteem and motivation to 
grow through her art work.&nbsp; </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Moderator (Lisa Donovan) Impressions: Across the board all 
panelists have a deep caring for their students. Building long term 
relationships with schools and staff is crucial to sustaining the life of the 
TA. Know who you are working with. Try to understand the point of view of the 
site. Making meaning relevant for students. Why are we doing this? Be patient 
with a process and having an opportunity to express, bringing the inside out.

<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The internet has exploded the traditional media world. 
Rapid change, fragmented environment, presents many new opportunities. 
Traditional print media: Build a relationship with journalists, writers, 
editors. Know what they want.&nbsp; Read what they write. By the time you call a 
writer to review a show, cover a residency; you have a greater understanding of 
the writer and what they want to cover. Present yourself just for small things, 
so when big events come up that you have a relationship. Be very choosey when 
you contact a journalist; be sure that it is a good story, worth their time. Be 
credible. Don’t waste the journalist’s time. Be judicious with their time, which 
is tight. Newspapers, traditional media tends to reach populations that are 
civically minded. So this is still a viable media for TAs to use to reach their 
audiences. Better for a 3rd party to call and be your advocate, 
someone with credibility in the community.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Creativity: central to working with the media be fun 
interesting take a different approach with your story. Story does not just have 
to be about your program, how to link to to a broader subject. Have a jpg ready 
(300dpi) to send for publicity. Almost all work is done electronically, don’t 
use an attachment, and use a straight text format. Only photos as an attachment. 
Or “Photos available on request” and send a brief story. </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Bypass traditional media and be your own best promoter. 
More of the public is getting news info outside of the traditional. Know your 
audience, how to reach them. An email news letter is a great way to connect with 
your audience.&nbsp; Email with opportunities, exhibitions, in plain text. For 
individual TAs this is a low cost, low maintenance way to get your voice out 
there.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Basic principles: Do some market research. Who do you want 
to reach?&nbsp; </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Identify how to reach them. Constantly gather email 
addresses. Public and private email addresses. Email address collection and 
management is critical. Keep your E-newsletter very simple. Keep your stories 
short. Have a sentence that links back to your website. Keep message as close to 
one page as you can. Links can provide deeper info. Keep it regular. Keep it 
fresh. Audience can expect to hear from you. You will build credibility. </span>
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Blog: not as effective as a marketing tool, require people 
to be more engaged. But good as a link for a longer piece.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Website: built in source to get to your newsletter. You can 
draw people back to your site. Testimonials are very important. Gather quotes to 
build credibility.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700">Presented by Robert Shreefter</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">What are the implications of connecting literacy with your 
art form? </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">This artist put together his art skills with literacy 
skills in book making. </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Everyone comes to school with skills. Uncover the joy and 
gifts of each individual. Make project accessible to all audiences. Reaching 
disenfranchised populations with heartwarming work. </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Art projects should provide opportunities for surprises and 
not knowing the outcome.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Leave room for debate and decision making for the kids 
among themselves. Link your art work not only with literacy but with another 
subject area, i.e., math.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Come to the classroom with a plan but allow the finished 
work to be completely different. The plan becomes a place for freedom, growth 
and experimentation. Up-end the curriculum! The artist shared numerous student 
created art-books and we created two small samples. </span></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">I found it valuable to see how another teaching artist 
links their medium with text and books. The samples were inspiring, especially 
the ones that were created by disenfranchised populations (homeless, 
incarcerated, mentally ill).</span></font></p>

give feedback to the planners. I was very impressed by the number of people who 
stay around to give their thoughts. The energy and dialogue was amazingly lively 
after two very long and intense days of seminars. Topics that were discussed:</font></p>
									<ul>
										<li>
										<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">How to bring younger artists into the field</font></li>
										<li>

heartwarming.</font></p>

on this forts Annual Teaching Artist Institute ~</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I am home now, two days after the institute has wrapped up. 
Writing this blog has helped me focus my thoughts and feelings. Yet I feel that 
I weeded out many wonderful stories to keep this document readable. A few 
lingering impressions:</font></p>
									<ul>
										<li>
										<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">The variety of ages, backgrounds, art-forms at times offered 
conflicting opinions on what is best for the TA profession. By nature the TA 
profession is a challenge to organize. </font></li>
