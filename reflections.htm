						<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">A few days 
						ago, October 9, was John &amp; Sean Lennon’s birthday. I’m 
						an admirer. A friend sent me a little video message by 
						cell phone that she took at Strawberry Fields in Central 
						Park – a place I had visited only a week earlier - of 
						people gathering and communally singing “Give Peace a 
						Chance” in John’s honor around the Imagine mosaic 
						adorned with flowers, apples and other memorial items. 
						This vigil in that colorful garden of peace takes place 
						every year, yet the words of the song seem even more 
						relevant now. On the same day (10/09) this week, our new 
						President accepted the Nobel Peace Prize during a time 
						of tremendous unrest, conflict and war. What would John 
						say?</span></font></p>

						Davis asked me to write a piece about my founding of an 
						organization called ArtPeace, Inc. in Rochester, NY five 
						years ago. I couldn’t get John’s song out of my head as 
						I went to write. It reminded me of the reason I created 
						the organization, ArtPeace, and of the origin of that 
						name – a combination of two of the most highly treasured 
						things in my life – Art and Peace. The Arts being a 
						vehicle through which to express and create Peace. 
						That’s what John Lennon did with such depth, flare and 
						artistic beauty. It may be interesting to note, that my 
						first born, a daughter, Shealyn Kassidy Rose, was also 
						born on October 9 – the “day of the penetrating gaze”. 
						Shea (now 12) and myself are thrilled that she has the 
						distinct honor to share that birthday with one of the 
						greatest artists and peacemakers our world has known.

						young people we work with, in addition to ourselves. I

						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">“Arts and 
						Social Justice” is what I have, some would say perhaps 
						unwisely, chosen to devote my career to. 5 years ago, I 
						left a good, safe job as a social worker in a 
						well-established local agency (with a salary, health 
						insurance and good benefits), to start a not-for-profit 
						organization, ArtPeace, Inc. (<a style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.artpeace.org/">www.artpeace.org</a>), 
						that provides arts, technology and entrepreneurship 
						opportunities to low-income and disadvantaged youth from 
						urban, suburban and rural settings in order to reform 
						education and create social change. We serve the 
						Rochester, NY and Southern Tier / Finger Lakes Regions.

						compensation), live without health insurance for my 
						family and occasionally work all night in a women’s 
						halfway house to make ends meet. Not as a martyr, but 
						these are the real choices of an “entrepreneur” striving

						creative education through arts and 
						technology-integrated work in schools (K – college);

						employment where young people are employed to start

						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Social 
						justice in the context of an organization like ArtPeace 
						is using the arts &amp; technology to even the playing field 
						for the under-served and impoverished. To educate in 
						engaging ways and to teach young people how to have a 
						real impact in their community. Arts are a vehicle for 
						expressing their voice and to help adults understand 
						them. It is a way for even very different people to work 
						together collaboratively and to demonstrate that we can 
						live in peace. It is also a way to make a living in an 
						uncertain world. As young people learn to be flexible, 
						creative thinkers with entrepreneurial and leadership 
						skills, they can make a way for themselves and live 
						fulfilling lives. After all, it is the creative among us 
						who will survive uncertain times. They will think on 
						their feet, solve problems, use limited resources 
						effectively and be able to take various talents to 
						create something new, with the currency of ideas. </font>

						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">The results 
						of ArtPeace work are promising in this data-driven 
						world. Programs are showing a real impact, including a 
						significant qualitative evaluation from the University 
						of Rochester Warner School; positive testimonies from 
						students, parents and teachers; a “Creative Ticket 
						Award” for excellence in arts-in-education in New York 
						State; and quantitative stats that show improved grades, 
						school attendance, promotion, behavior and attitudes. 
						There are challenges too many to name as well, but it is 
						the work with kids and artists that tell the real story 
						of ArtPeace. It’s the teaching artists who choose this 
						profession despite living at poverty level and working 
						many jobs because they can’t imagine living their life 
						doing anything else. It’s the boy who couldn’t talk or 
						write who is reciting a poem in a public showcase of 
						arts learning. The girl who came to school just to dance 
						in the learning showcase. The employed youth who got a 
						creative spark that kept him off the streets. The 12 
						young adults who are right now drumming up work for 
						their new TV production and digital media business, 
						incubated by ArtPeace Young Entrepreneurs. The young 
						leaders who are now inspiring others with creative ideas 
						and going to college. </font></p>

						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">In closing, a 
						poetic statement that sums up my personal quest to keep 
						pioneering change in this burgeoning field of arts-based 
						learning. During a teaching artist training session in 
						the summer of 2008, facilitated by John Cimino, director 
						of Creative Leaps (arts &amp; learning consultants), 
						participants were asked to choose from a multitude of 
						colorful photos John had strewn across the ballroom 
						floor and overflowing into the hallway, depicting a 
						myriad of different images. From these, we selected only 
						a few and then wrote a personal manifesto that rose up 
						out of the pictures and our own thinking about their 
						connection to our work and to who we are as artists, 
						teachers, leaders and individuals. </font></p>

						and selling the programs to the schools.&nbsp; My own 
						artwork, photography, writing, scripting, has, up until 
						recently, been a bit on the back burner, and though I 
						never really stopped creating and doing the work much of

						cameras for her school’s extended day program.&nbsp; This 
						year’s photography program was designed to build upon 
						our previous program that not only connected literacy, 
						technology and career development skills, (the 
						all-important learning standards!) but fostered works 
						that the students themselves observed were good, that

						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Just two days before the start of the program, the 
						district leadership changed the plan.&nbsp; The high school 
						students would not be participating but during this fall 
						cycle, the elementary students from the nearby school 
						would be walked over to the high school and the program 
						would consist of paraprofessionals from the elementary 
						school and teachers from the high school.&nbsp; Day one was a 
						minor disaster.&nbsp; The teachers simply didn’t know what to 
						do.&nbsp; We were able to show the second graders some 
						pictures, they were able to take a few snap shots, but 
						they just wanted to run around, play games, and we spent 
						most of the time just trying to maintain some sort of 
						organization.&nbsp;</font></p>

						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">The principal was apologetic and said it was out of her 
						hands, but to try to “make due” with the situation.&nbsp; I 
						met with the two teachers and we came up with a 
						contingency plan of some photography and drawing 
						pictures.&nbsp; It worked a little better than day one, but 
						this too was unsatisfactory.&nbsp; At the end of the session 
						I told the two teachers who were rather miffed with the 
						situation that I had a bunch of pirate costumes and we 
						could make a “living story book”.&nbsp; Some of the 
						youngsters showed they had the attention span for taking 
						pictures, and those that didn’t could enact the story we 
						would create.</font></p>

						<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">This turned out to be the magic formula.&nbsp; The young 
						children loved dressing up in the costumes.&nbsp; They loved 
						getting their pictures taken.&nbsp; The students who took the 
						pictures were thrilled with their photography and they 
						too had a chance to dress in costumes.&nbsp; In that the 
						students themselves have attention difficulties, I 
						showed the teachers theatre games, the mirror game, and 
						other games that slow young children down and help build 
						concentration and focusing skills.&nbsp; By making the 
						program a multi-dimensional arts program where the 
						students wrote short pieces, enacted short vignettes, 
						looked at their photographs on their computers and 
						received a printout of the work they were doing turned 
						the program into a success.&nbsp; I also had the insight to 
						request one of the para-professionals participate and 
						get into costume to be part of the storybook. Doing this 
						made the project “real” not only for the young students, 
						but for the staff as well who never considered actively 
						participating.&nbsp; Needless to say the principal and the 
						staff were very, very grateful.</font></p>

						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">On September 11, 2004 I boarded a flight in cool 
						green, Seattle, Washington and landed the next day in 
						Kuwait where the temperature was over 115 degrees.&nbsp; 
						Within days I would begin my teaching at Kuwait

						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Prior to arriving my stereotypes of this culture 
						coincided with predominant cultural stereotypes of the 
						Middle East as viewed through popular and news media.&nbsp; 
						Stereotypes perpetuated by popular films portray the 
						Arab world as a place of endless hot deserts where 
						camels roam among cruel and barbaric people. &nbsp;However, 
						my ideas were also specific to my profession - teaching 
						studio arts.&nbsp; Based on my limited knowledge of Kuwait, I 
						believed:</font></p>
						<ul>
							<li><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I would have to 
							wear abaya and hejab (long black robe and head 
							scarf) </font> </li>
							<li><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I could not teach 
							art using the figure, face, animal or flowers
							</font>
							</li>
							<li><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I could not use 
							nude models
						</font>
						</li>
							<li><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I could not show 
							pictures of nude or semi-nude models </font> </li>
						</ul>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">As a professor I dress in 
							the same skirts, blouses, dresses and slacks I wear 
							when teaching in America.&nbsp; Instead of posing nude 
							models for traditional gesture drawings, I have 
							students in my all women classes pose for quick 
							drawings.&nbsp; However, since most of my students wear abaya and hejab these gesture drawings are more like 
							fabric studies.&nbsp; Still life materials substitute for 
							the organic forms found in the human figure.</div>
						</font>
						</p>
						
							
						
									<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Library textbooks are edited by the Ministry of 
							Education (pictures revealing any semblance of 
							nudity are pasted over with thick-white stickers), 
							yet student purchased textbooks in art history, even 
							though edited for the Middle East, often contain 
							uncensored nudity.</div></font><p>
									<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">While some students feel more secure “copying” from 
							photographs, others paint and draw combining realism 
							with imagination. Some will not render facial 
							features.&nbsp; At first I believed this was because of 
							their religion or something depicted in the Qurán, 
							the holy book of Muslims.&nbsp; While this is true in 
							some cases, I discovered students avoided rendering 
							facial features because they had no prior experience 
							in portraiture and did not want to ruin a figure 
							drawing eyes, nose and mouth.</div>
						</font>
						</p>
						
									<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Fatma, who removes her black gloves and face veil in 
							class, only when the curtains are drawn (the only 
							males to see her face are her immediate family 
							father, brother and uncle) explains why she cannot 
							draw faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;“When I was a child I did draw the 
							faces.&nbsp; When I got older I was told it was haram 
							(bad).&nbsp; So I stop.&nbsp; You can draw faces if it is in 
							cartoons or sometimes if it is serious, like in 
							study. But then you must draw a little line across 
							the neck.”&nbsp;The line would indicate the drawing was 
							inanimate like a manikin.&nbsp; Fatma &nbsp;explained that to 
							draw faces would be to emulate the work of Allah or 
							God, the only entity righteous enough to create 
							human and animal forms.&nbsp; However, there are students 
							with an express desire to learn portraiture and 
							practice on their own time.</div>
						</font>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Learning to adapt my studio instruction in 
							consideration with the culture and elements meant 
							using water-soluble pigments and vehicles instead of 
							oil-based media.&nbsp; Between the air conditioning and 
							the intense heat, acrylic paint dries too rapidly 
							for blending, and lack of ventilation (curtains have 
							to be drawn when students remove hejab) prevents use 
							of oil paint.</div>
						</font>
						</p>
						
									<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">As an artist and arts educator, I’ve learned 
							teaching studio arts in a Muslim country is like 
							creating a semi-abstract painting – experience, 
							emotion, perceptions are distilled and projected 
							through the mind’s eye whether it be on a canvas or 
							a culture.&nbsp; To paint an honest presentation is to 
							see beyond one’s veil of stereotypes.</div>

							was a magic in the air, an energy to these classes 
							that I had never experienced before. Far from being 
							dull, my interactions with the students were lively 
							and totally unpredictable. All I needed to do was to 
							create a safe and welcoming atmosphere in front of 
							virtually anything in the museum and ask open-ended 
							questions to get the ball rolling. Within a few 
							minutes the students understood that this was not a 
							typical class, but an opportunity for them to 
							fearlessly express themselves. The only rule was 
							unspoken - that they speak
							from their hearts. Everyone is invited to observe 
							the art in silence and ask questions or make 
							comments. I was delighted to find that it made 
							absolutely no difference if the student was young or 
							old, well versed in art history or a first time 
							museum visitor - the playing field was perfectly 
							even. Often the most eloquent, insightful, memorable 
							comments were made by those who had never set foot 
							in a museum. My temporary job quickly became a 
							vocation. I felt a true calling in my work, 
							particularly with Public School Students who had 
							little or no access to art education.<br class="khtml-block-placeholder">&nbsp;</font></div>

                          When I joined the faculty of the University at Buffalo 
                          Educational Opportunity Center in 1977, I adapted to 
                          the scheduling and professional demands of higher 
                          education. Some years later, however, I found I missed 
                          the kind of children I had encountered during my four 
                          years as a secondary English teacher. One of my 
                          solutions was to return to public school classrooms as 
                          a visiting writer for the Just Buffalo Literary 
                          Center's Writers in Education program. For nearly two 
                          decades, I've worked around my university schedule to 
                          spend five to ten days a year in public schools, 
                          working with a host teacher, or teachers, to give 
                          creative writing experiences to children.</font></div>

                          My experiences have been varied and satisfying. I have 
                          worked with junior high and high school students on 
                          writing poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. For two 
                          schools I helped develop an integrated curriculum 
                          project that produced publications. In the first 
                          school, students studying the Westward Expansion in 
                          social studies learned period music in music class, 
                          surveying techniques in math class, and produced &quot;You 
                          Are There&quot; style Western newspapers in English. In the 
                          second school, students studying the Great Depression 
                          in social studies, read Depression-era literature and 
                          watched Depression-era films in English and produced a 
                          news magazine summarizing the decade, including book 
                          and film reviews, news stories, and obituaries of the 
                          famous who died during that period. For two years I 
                          helped another school develop two websites and publish 
                          online magazines of student writing, art, and 
                          photography.</font></div>

                          I have had students write to classical music and film 
                          scores, blindfold themselves and write about their 
                          other senses, look through a telescope and create 
                          stories about what they see, pass stories around a 
                          classroom with each student adding two lines, and 
                          write plays in pairs. None of my secondary 
                          experiences, however, prepared me for the exuberance 
                          of the fourth-grade poets I encountered at Martin 
                          Luther King Academy in the spring of 2005.</font></div>

                          I was the visiting writer in the classrooms of four 
                          teachers (Ms. Carson, Mrs. Dixon, Ms. Fields, and Mrs. 
                          Polak) who were unsure what to expect from a visiting 
                          writer. In our initial planning meeting we discussed a 
                          variety of instructional possibilities, from getting 
                          students to write about their feelings to producing 
                          poems on the Erie Canal, which they had studied. The 
                          more we talked, however, the more creative we became, 
                          and the writing lessons that took shape were more 
                          successful than any of us could have imagined.</font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt"><br>

                          English sometimes seems a harsh companion, impossible 
                          to master and unforgiving of errors. Over the years, 
                          on all levels, I've had students say, &quot;Is this what 
                          you want? Did I do it right?&quot; With the fourth-graders 
                          at MLK, we approached language from the point of view 
                          of a challenge. There was no right and wrong at this 
                          point, I said, only words that we would come up with 
                          and use. In one lesson I explained haiku to them, 
                          using construction paper signs to demonstrate 
                          syllables, which we later mixed and matched to create 
                          new words. In another lesson, we discussed synonyms 
                          and had students generate lists; in others, students 
                          generated lists of rhymes and words associated with 
                          feelings, colors, families, home, and the like. 
                          Perhaps the most memorable lesson involved a giant 
                          Scrabble game made from poster board and post-it 
                          notes, which the entire class played to generate a new 
                          list of words. Each time we created word lists or 
                          demonstrated a particular poetic pattern, the 
                          challenge was to copy the pattern or write something 
                          using only the words on the list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></font></div>

                          In the end, we were all transported so far beyond 
                          tradition that we had 100% participation in every 
                          class. Students rose to each challenge 
                          enthusiastically, willingly reading their work aloud 
                          and applauding their peers. Even the teachers 
                          participated as writers, and their work appears in the 
                          booklet of poems and pictures each class published. 
                          The few students who did not appear in print were 
                          excluded because they failed to turn in their parent 
                          permission slips. (Desire to be included was so high 
                          that two students even tried to forge permission 
                          slips.) Weeks after the residency concluded, I 
                          returned to the school for a special program during 
                          which all the fourth graders (and their teachers) read 
                          and performed their poetry for other teachers, 
                          administrators, and parents.</font></div>
