                        ‘journals’…probably cause I shared a tiny room
                        with my younger sister who co-opted everything I owned
                        if she couldn’t find her own stuff and I never felt
                        the diary I was given by my parents could be private.&nbsp;
                        I just write all the time</span><o:p></o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">.

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">We don’t only work with
                        incarcerated students.&nbsp; The following are bits and
                        pieces of the dialogues I had on line this spring with
                        students from NYC Vocational Training Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Despite the rough edginess to these kids, there’s a
                        sweetness and truth to what they express. </span> <o:p>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The day starts with looking at
                        the e mail, which today contained a note from one of our
                        vocational students attending a class sited at Bronx
                        Community College. NYC Vocational Training Center has
                        cohorts of students at 50 NYC hospitals, nursing homes,
                        schools, colleges, computer firms, hotels where they
                        receive 90 minutes daily of academic instruction from
                        their teacher and spend the rest of the day in
                        experiential learning.&nbsp; Students work toward GED,
                        diploma completion, IEP diploma or to gain enough entry
                        level skills in a field that they can become employed.&nbsp;
                        Although the mission of the program is to teach the
                        students market ready skills so they can become
                        gainfully employed, if they do leave to take a job
                        they’re considered drop outs unless they’re special
                        ed students.&nbsp; Then it’s considered a victory to
                        be employed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Let’s stop and take a breath
                        and think about it.&nbsp; Much as it would&nbsp; be
                        loverly (maybe) for all students to get diplomas and go
                        on to college some would be happier…more
                        productive…higher paid even…more centered…if they
                        became plumbers or roofers.&nbsp; In the real world
                        those folks probably are more needed than the average
                        lawyer, or architect, or of course those of us who are
                        artists.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Some of the teachers at VTC have
                        academic licenses, others vocational.&nbsp; The teacher
                        at this site has a vocational license (as an
                        electrician), but has studied the teaching of writing in
                        graduate classes at Lehman College with among others,
                        Virginia Scott, a fine Canadian poet who we’ve
                        published in our adult poetry magazine (Waterways:
                        Poetry in the Mainstream).</span></p>
                        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The students enter their writing
                        into Streams on Line and when the teacher approves the
                        material we can see it.&nbsp; The teacher’s told me
                        that he works with the students on their grammar and
                        spelling but he often lets the material come through
                        with mistakes visible.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he’s going to do
                        that, my own preference would be for him to write his own
                        comments and make them visible too, so we can see what
                        he’s teaching the student and so we can watch the
                        process and enjoy the student’s victory as he learns.&nbsp;
                        He rarely does that however. I suppose he’s as shy as
                        his students.</span></p>
                        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In transcribing the student’s
                        writing I’ve corrected the spelling and most egregious
                        grammar errors.&nbsp; The most involved student this
                        term was Anthony who is so motivated and determined to
                        succeed that he plods along at his own pace ignoring the
                        obstacles…and moving ahead anyway.&nbsp; He’s 17 and
                        has more time to learn than the typical alternative
                        student who has few credits and is about ready to age
                        out.</span></p>
                        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Anthony had been a student at a
                        Bronx comprehensive high school, or rather he had been
                        on their register.&nbsp; He hardly ever showed up at
                        that school.&nbsp; He registered in NYC Vocational
                        Training Center at the end of December.&nbsp; He took
                        the Adult Basic Education test on 1/03/02 and his
                        reading level was 4.5.&nbsp; </span> <o:p>

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Anthony spent a lot of time working
                        on Streams On Line, writing and reading other
                        student’s work as well as making comments about what
                        he read.&nbsp; Our designer put a web server on the
                        program that stores statistics about the use.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        By June 7 Anthony had made 187 entries.&nbsp; On 6/04/02
                        he was tested again and scored 9.9+.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                        work with other people, to have associates who care to
                        work with you is an antidote to the coldness of the
                        streets.&nbsp; One of the adult poets Waterways
                        publishes a lot, Albert Huffstickler, died in Texas a
                        few weeks ago.&nbsp; He didn't leave a will. Another
                        poet we know Felicia Mitchell who lives in Virginia has
                        been working on collecting Huff's poems into a book.
                        He'd given her permission to do that. A stranger who
                        never met Huff spoke to his daughter and is trying to
                        convince her that no one wants to read Huff's poetry. He
                        called Huff a street poet which is not true by the way.&nbsp;
                        This grifter wants to get the poetry to publish
                        himself.&nbsp; You guys made some strong points about
                        the danger of the street.&nbsp; Most of the time people
                        people are into stealing money or the gold around a
                        person's neck.&nbsp; How would you feel if someone tried
                        to rip off your poetry?</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                        trying to steal my work, and the publisher printed a

                        is to make sure that all feel that they're being honored
                        for their contribution. We all know the stories of back

                        Millionaire Schemer?&quot;&nbsp; Seems that in
                        Pennsylvania an attorney and his wife had an acrimonious
                        divorce.&nbsp; The husband is completing his 7th year in
                        jail 'not as a criminal but on an order of civil
                        contempt of court.'&nbsp; He had been a millionaire.&nbsp;
                        The problem began in 1992 &quot;with a court order to
                        produce $2.5 million in potential alimony assets.&quot;&nbsp;
                        He refused saying he'd lost lots of money in bad
                        investments.&nbsp; The courts have ruled against him
                        many times.&nbsp; His wife's attorney says he's
                        &quot;stashed his wealth in a maze of overseas accounts,
                        and was holding out in prison in a scheme to reap assets
                        that might already be worth $6 million.&quot;&nbsp;

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">I believe that my freedom is more
                        important than money or anything else. I think that
                        people who value money more than their freedom are
                        foolish and not very wise. Money comes and goes, but
                        freedom is something that will always be around. Freedom
                        is one of the most valuable things that anyone could
                        ever have. To me, money is evil. A lot of murders and
                        cruel people mostly hurt or kill for money. Money also
                        changes people too. People end up using others just it
                        get money. I don't understand, why the world is the way
                        is it. When people die, the money goes to someone else.
                        We cannot take our money with us. The world relies on so
                        many bad things that people depend on it. So many people
                        are in jail because of money. I think that people who go
                        to jail could change and cannot at the same time. Some
                        are willing to make is difference for the better, but
                        some end up going right back to jail. But everyone
                        deserves a chance to prove themselves to the world..&nbsp;
                        Issues come up when it comes to jail. Sometimes people
                        don't belong there. Many people are blamed and accused
                        for a crime that they did not do.&nbsp; There are so
                        many different opinions and issues on this topic that
                        makes it hard to decide.&nbsp; </span> <o:p>

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">This is a very touching comment
                        cause the simple fact is that the person that is in jail
                        only wants to stay in cause he wants to stay with his
                        money when he gets out.&nbsp; But everybody was asking
                        does this person really have all that money or is this
                        person planning to just say there is none, so when he
                        comes out of jail there will be no problem with someone
                        able to know about all the money. But imagine if the
                        person really does have that money, when he comes out of
                        jail he will take the first plane, train whatever and be
                        gone.&nbsp; This will continue in life if someone has
                        money and the other person doesn’t want the other to
                        know.&nbsp; Of course they’re gonna say that they
                        don't have it and live their life once they come out.
                        But if they don't then that person has some serious
                        issues.&nbsp; But to continue in the process is the best
                        thing to do till the day comes when you come out of jail
                        and tell yourself do you want to be with your wife or do
                        you want to continue your life with a new person.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                        idea basic to our whole judicial system that a person is
                        presumed innocent until proven guilty.&nbsp; No one has

                        unjust and cruel,' is not far from the issue of racial
                        profiling - as in&nbsp; New Jersey traffic violations
                        where people said they were 'arrested while driving
                        black' or folks not being allowed to travel on an

                        using others just to get money.'&nbsp; How different is

                        unseen. People have to realize that there is more to
                        life than money, power, or material things. Many people
                        don't see what is inside the mind, heart, or the soul.
                        Those things are the most important things about life. I
                        write to show people to truth and I try to guide them.
                        There is no point in being wise if the wise one doesn't
                        try to give others wisdom. A lot of people are so busy
                        with their own issues that they don't see the important
                        things. I don't know everything, no one does, but I do
                        know about what is important and my goals to complete
                        them. I also write to make myself happy, as well as to
                        give people what ever wisdom that I know. </span> <o:p>

                        feelings. Some people have a hard time expressing their
                        thoughts or feelings through verbal use. Because of this
                        they write. One who is silent through words may be loud
                        with the pen and with that knowledge we must remember
                        the pen is mightier then the sword. My use of the pen is
                        to state words from my heart. Instead of speaking
                        directly to the person and revealing my heart, what I do
                        is cover it up to protect it if the person drops it so
                        it will not be broken.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                        people's lives and thoughts through the ages comes
                        through the words that were put on cave walls, on
                        papyrus, printed or drawn on paper, and handed down
                        aurally by poets who traveled from place to place
                        performing their words and those of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Interesting places to learn about feelings of the heart
                        are cemetaries where information about &nbsp;the people
                        who are buried there is carved on the stones.&nbsp; When
                        at a cemetary&nbsp; I sometimes dream about those people
                        and create in my head stories to explain the little bit
                        about their lives we learn from reading the stones.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                        to try and understand the emotions and point of view of
                        others.&nbsp; Sometimes in writing you create characters
                        who talk through you rather than about you and in
                        creating those characters the fiction writer or
                        playwright has to step out of his or her own center and
                        try to write dialogue that matches another person's
                        feelings.&nbsp; Sometimes it's serious stuff; at others
                        you can play with situations and language, have fun with

                        program at PS 41 in Greenwich Village.&nbsp; Kit ate
                        lots of vegetables, fruit and other good stuff.&nbsp;
                        &nbsp;Muckleyuk existed only on soda, candy,
                        cookies...stuff that was sugar based.&nbsp; I did
                        stories and poems about these two characters to the

                        the pen mightier than the sword in that I chronicled the
                        battle between a monster and a young person, but there
                        was a fight between the force for good --healthful

                        Streams, but I think that Streams should add that people
                        could have their own web pages while they are on
                        streams. With their own web pages on streams, people can

                        Cullen both wrote a poem about dreams.&nbsp; Cullen
                        talks about how he puts his dreams on hold. However,
                        Langston Hughes responded to Cullen’s poem and asks
                        questions that are related to dreams. For example,
                        &quot; I have wrapped my dreams in a silken cloth&quot;
                        and &quot; what happens to a dream deferred&quot;. They
                        both explain how life can be hard and cruel when it
                        comes to not completing a dream. What I like about them
                        is that they give so much detail, but is poem is simple
                        and short. For example, &quot; who found earth’s
                        breath so keen and cold&quot; . &quot; Or fester like a
                        sore and then run&quot;.&nbsp; We can all see that both
                        poets are on the same track when it comes to dreams and
                        disappointments. The both of them are talented and great
                        writers. But, I like Countee Cullen’s poem a lot more
                        because a golden box or a silken cloth kind of has a
                        beautiful touch to poetry itself.&nbsp; </span> <o:p>

                        the traveler that is searching of love because the part
                        when &quot;the lone and level sands stretch far
                        away&quot;.&nbsp; It could mean that the loneliness goes
                        far away by stretching itself. I think that the poet is
                        sad with disappointment by the part when &quot;wrinkled
                        lip, and sneer of cold command&quot;. It’s possible
                        that the coldness of his loneliness is like a desert.
                        Poetry on dreams lets out hidden feelings or memories.

                        writers such as Shelley, Hughes and Cullen, I am hopeful
                        that you will be able to enrich your own writing with
                        language that also reach the feelings of the reader.

						<span style="font-size: 11pt">At
                        a lonesome night a man walks down the street. The
                        environment seemed cold and damp. The man walked with
                        silence, like a child without its toy. He never got
                        tired of his search. The movement of how he walked was
                        like his legs were broken. Then he pulled up his head
                        with great speed. Both of his eyes shined like a golden
                        black marble. He saw a woman. Her beauty reflected the
                        light of the sun. The light went from the inside to the
                        outside of her body and heart. Before he was able go up
                        to her, she started to run. The man started to chase
                        her. He had reached a dead end. The man became sleepy
                        and collapsed on the ground. It so happened that he was
                        dying. The woman appeared out of nowhere and pulled him
                        up. When he was pulled up, he could still see his body
                        lying there. The man was surprised and asked the
                        woman,&quot; I never though that I would ever see you
                        again, I missed you.&quot; The woman smiles as she
                        forcefully told him, &quot;We are together at
                        last!&quot; The sunrise started to travel around all
                        living things. Just as the sun came, they gave each
                        other a romance kiss. Then they both disappeared, like a
                        shadow in the night. </span> <o:p>

                        imaginative piece. It is based on the universal theme of
                        man meeting woman.&nbsp; There is some similarity in
                        your story with the myth of Endymion, which you might
                        want to look up on the Internet.&nbsp; As far as the
                        telling of the story, there are things that you might
                        want to polish.&nbsp; </span> <o:p>

                        here. For example, you've set the story at night yet you
                        speak of the female character as reflecting 'the light
                        of the sun.'&nbsp; The moonlight while beautiful, is a
                        cold, clear light while the sun is warm and golden and
                        given your description of the environment as damp and
                        cold your description is confusing.&nbsp; </span> <o:p>

                        successfully conveys your feelings when you are simple

                        one of your poems 'A Long Walk to Love' is very clear

                        that the setting and some other parts to the story could
                        be confusing. The story has a certain secret to it. For
                        example, &quot;Before he was able go up to her, she
                        started to run.&quot; And &quot;They gave each other a
                        romantic kiss. Then they both disappeared, like a shadow
                        in the night.&quot; I realize that my other poem &quot;A
                        long walk to love&quot; has some similarities. But, I
                        will take the advice that you gave me and use it to
                        create another story. I will summit it in Streams and
                        E-mail you as soon as I finish it. I heard that you know
                        about my TABE test scores. I am still surprised about
                        the scores. I worked hard in this semester, but I
                        didn’t think that I have improved that much. I have to
                        thank Jack for helping me and Streams for all of the

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">You do have a point, but there are
                        many poems that do not describe any person. The poem
                        still has a meaning to it even though it does not have a
                        character or person in it. Even though having a
                        character makes the poem more interesting, but sometimes
                        it is not used. Thanks for commenting! Hope you comment
                        some more!</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">True.&nbsp; But the poem to have
                        impact on the reader must articulate through its imagery
                        what's on the poet's mind. What's foolish to you might
                        be wise to me.&nbsp; Just listing the words doesn't lend
                        insight or involve the reader in what you might be
                        feeling as the poet.&nbsp; Keeping a poem spare and
                        short doesn't necessarily give it more punch.&nbsp;

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">You are right! But, I was trying
                        something different than just using a character to
                        express what I am feeling. Even though the poem
                        doesn’t have as much of punch as if a character would
                        have been in it, it explains my point. If you take all
                        the words in the poem, then you could understand what I
                        am trying to say. For example, people that are
                        &quot;being childish&quot; are
                        people with a &quot;foolish
                        mind&quot;. Another example, people that make &quot; bad
                        choices&quot; are &quot; being unwise&quot;. My poem may
                        not have an affect on people, but it does express my
                        feelings. </span> <o:p>

                        feeling - but the reader's understanding of these words
                        might be very different from yours. I don't know what
                        you mean by the words 'being childish' or 'being unwise'
                        without an example.&nbsp; In the cartoon 'Rose is Rose'
                        the main character turns cartwheels when the weather is
                        nice.&nbsp; Because children generally do cartwheels and
                        adults do
                        not, some people would think this
                        is childish behavior.&nbsp; Another would think it
                        charming.&nbsp; </span> <o:p>

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Another example: The movies used to
                        portray adult characters as smokers and heavy drinkers.&nbsp;
                        They don't do this as often because many now believe
                        this behavior to be unwise ... and also childish
                        ...because smoking and heavy drinking is equated with
                        not looking at the long view of what you do and how it
                        will affect your future - this type of behavior is often
                        considered
                        childish cause little kids don't
                        have enough information or life experience to take the
                        wise view of actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <o:p>

                        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">So, Anthony what I'm trying to
                        explain - in a long winded fashion is that just listing
                        the words without adding a descriptor, a simile, a
                        metaphor, a comparison doesn't give the reader your
                        whole story because we don't clearly understand your
                        feelings.&nbsp; Since your meaning of the word childish
                        might not be the same as mine I'm not necessarily
                        understanding your feelings.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                        could be childish in their choices and their way of
                        acting. I feel that silly immature people have a
                        &quot;foolish mind&quot;. People that take things for
                        granted will not understand a lot of certain wisdom
                        because they’re to busy playing childish games. I try
                        to create my poetry with an ambiguous meaning. I do that
                        because I try to make it mysteries by mixing up
                        different feelings. I also add my advice and wisdom to
                        the poetry to. I should’ve put more detail by adding a
                        character into my poem &quot;a foolish mind&quot;.
