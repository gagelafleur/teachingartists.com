								<span style="font-size: 11pt">I didn’t intentionally decide to become a 
								Teaching Artist.&nbsp; I was living in Los Angeles 
								and felt like my pursuit of an acting career in 
								Los Angeles was not fulfilling. I come from a 
								family of activists and discovered that they had 
								rooted in me a deeper responsibility to be of 
								contribution to my community than I realized.&nbsp;I 
								loved the theater, but not the business of 
								promoting a career as an actor so I sought out 
								information on MFA programs in directing with 
								the plan to work with young people in 
								theater.&nbsp;Turns out, you need to submit a 
								directing portfolio for MFA programs and since I 
								had not directed before, I began working with a 
								couple of youth theaters in my hometown of New 
								Orleans.&nbsp;The hurricane hit a week later and my 
								family moved to Atlanta.&nbsp; My sister had 
								substitute taught before and applied to Atlanta 
								Public Schools for substitute teaching. When 
								they called her in for fingerprinting, I went 
								with her and signed up also. Took an assignment 
								a month later and at the end of my first school 
								day, the principal asked me what else I do and 
								ended up offering me my own drama class.</span></font></p>

								beginning teachers, I didn’t know what I was 
								doing, but I knew even less because I had never 
								taken an education class.&nbsp; It was hard. I cried 
								a lot and felt like a failure even more often, 
								but the small successes I saw in the middle 
								schoolers as they memorized tongue twisters, 
								wrote skits, improvised scenes, it motivated me 
								to want to learn how to do this better.&nbsp; Through 
								another set of circumstances divinely laid out 
								for me, I discovered the MA program in Education 
								Theater at NYU and started my Teaching Artist 
								journey.</span></font></p>
