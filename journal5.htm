									<span style="font-size: 11pt">Michael Rutherford is a graduate of SUNY Albany with a BA in English
                        and a Masters in Library Science. He is the founder and director of
                        Alternative Literary Programs (ALPS) and was the co-founder of Cultural
                        Conspiracy, Inc. which published Artists with Class, a quarterly
                        addressing the concerns of teaching artists. When he was younger (as
                        opposed to his ongoing childhood) he translated Catullus and published
                        numerous poems. Now that he has grown older and more garrulous, he has
                        moved into prose, writing literary sword and sorcery tales. His
                        novella, THE TALE AND ITS MASTER, Spring Harbor Press, 1986 was
                        nominated as one of the year's best fantasy novellas and then
                        anthologized in THE YEAR'S BEST FANTASY STORIES, DAW Press in 1987. His
                        collection of fantasy novellas, THE INFINITE KINGDOMS, followed in
                        1990. Currently he has a fantasy novel, MORTAL BEAUTY, making the
                        perilous rounds of publishing houses.</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt;

                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">When did I start my crooked career
                        as a teaching artist? It’s a little frightening to
                        realize that I started thirty years ago with the now
                        defunct Poets in the Schools.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Though actually it was even earlier
                        than that. I started teaching street kids film-making
                        for the Upper Hudson Library Federation. In retrospect,
                        my naivety was prodigious. I thought of these tough,
                        troubled and often abused kids as angels with dirty
                        faces. The only reason I use this cliché is that my
                        attitude at this point was so banal and flawed.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">My students tried to disabuse me of
                        this as quickly and pointedly as possible. We shot a
                        movie in my apartment with about 7 kids acting and in
                        production; the few objects I had of value vanished and
                        the only reason I kept working this particular crew was
                        that it was impossible to figure out who the thieves
                        were. In those heady, ignorant days of poisonous
                        romanticism, the library also gave kids cheap super 8mm
                        cameras to shoot whatever they found meaningful. Kids,
                        of course, were natural artists and would create works
                        of Rousseau-like innocence and power. What we did get
                        were works of perverse integrity: kids beating the crap
                        out of each other, stealing bicycles. Then there was the
                        day one schizophrenic father began beating his son on
                        the steps of the library. Being somewhat strong, I
                        pulled the father off his son and then got attacked by
                        the kid AND the father.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">But the worst was the reaction of
                        the Library Federation. They had told me that I’d get
                        paid more if I got an MLS (Master of Library Science
                        Degree), an oxymoronic definition of library expertise.
                        My position was that I wanted to work with kids (no
                        matter what their thievish, thuggish, ungrateful
                        natures).</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">So I got my library Masters and was
                        immediately assigned to being a reference librarian,
                        since I was overqualified to work with poor kids. Being
                        a reference librarian involved writing suburban kids’
                        term papers for them. So I quit the library and started
                        working for Poets in the Schools.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">All I can say about the (mostly
                        African American) kids I worked with through the library
                        system is that I’m still in touch with some after
                        thirty years, know the jail records of others and have
                        attended funerals.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">There was another equally
                        outrageous factor, though I find the Library world one
                        of superbly impractical majesty. I was flying. At 25, I
                        was trying to figure out whether I should be a
                        professional hot air balloonist or a teaching poet.
                        I’d lied on a car loan and bought a hot air balloon.
                        Much to my surprise, I’d displayed a real talent for
                        flying gas bags. I suppose the real measure of my
                        practicality was that I was trying to figure out whether
                        to earn a living as a poet or the Wizard of Oz.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Hot air ballooning has a lot to
                        recommend it to the young artist. It’s inherently
                        dangerous. It affords an incredible view of the world in
                        its drifting isolation. It’s like walking in the air.
                        And above all, it’s not really quiet. In order to keep
                        the balloon above the ground, you have to blast a flame
                        that erupts like a lion’s roar into the crown of the
                        balloon. There’s also a wonderful satisfaction in
                        knowing that if you mishandle the propane tanks or
                        forget to seal the valves of the fuel lines, you’ll
                        blow up.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">I managed to get a few grants to do
                        poetry readings and throw poems from balloons. But
                        ballooning is inherently expensive; extremely expensive
                        as I discovered, when the lawyers and doctors whom I was
                        teaching systematically ran into dead trees and ripped
                        holes in the balloon. As a practical matter, because of
                        wind and weather conditions, I could only fly or put the
                        balloon up in store parking lots to advertise special
                        events one day in three. Daily income was great, but it
                        was totally unpredictable.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
						</span>
                        </o:p>
                        </p>
                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">It became clear to me that it would
                        take a full-time effort to make a living at being either
                        a poet in the schools or a commercial hot air balloon
                        pilot. I liked kids more than the people I taught flying
                        to and the schools were never closed because of high
                        winds or hot air. There was enough work in Poets in the
                        Schools to scrape by. It was obvious. Being a poet in
                        America offered more stability.</span></p>
