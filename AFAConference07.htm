									Americans for the Arts Conference: <br>
							Risk and Reward<br>
							Balancing Acts in the Arts Community<br>
							Las Vegas, June 1 -3, 2007<br>
									<b>Courtney Boddie</b>, Education Programs Manager, The New 
							Victory Theater</font></p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
											</span>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">During the 
							flights from 
							New York City to Atlanta, Atlanta to Las Vegas, 8 
							hours of travel and driving approximately 5 miles 
							from the Las Vegas McCarran International Airport to 
							Las Vegas Boulevard, I was thinking about the themes 
							casinos, shopping, good food, glitz, glamour and of 
							course, Celine Dion.&nbsp; As I checked-in to The 
							Flamingo Hotel, I was reminded that I was in 
							America’s fastest growing city to join a national 
							conversation about the Arts in America.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Before the conference 
							got into full swing, I thought about how my 
							colleagues and I became apart of this annual event. 
							Our proposal for an Innovative Model was accepted by 
							the conference coordinators.&nbsp; To give you a little 
							background on my organization and how we work: The 
							New Victory Theater is a performing arts presenting 
							house, where schools attend day time performances 
							throughout a season (October – June). As an 
							Education Programs Manager, my role is to supervise 
							the In-classroom Workshop Program. This program is 
							building partnerships with schools throughout the 
							NYC metropolitan area, by sending a team of 2 
							Teaching Artists or an Education staff member and a 
							Teaching Artist, to prepare students to see a show.&nbsp; 
							The team engages students as artists in the art form 
							they will see on stage and return to provide 
							opportunities for students to make their own 
							connections to the production by further exploring 
							the themes through the art form. The Education Staff 
							and Teaching Artists work in collaboration to 
							develop the curriculum for all the shows in a 
							season, using resource materials and the artist’s 
							experiences to give students interactive and 
							experiential entry points for the students and 
							teachers to access the work for themselves.&nbsp; How we 
							develop our curriculum was the basis for our 
							presentation on at the conference.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">In the fall of 2006, our 
							teaching artist staff doubled in size from 13 to 29 
							based on the demand of the In-Classroom Workshop 
							Program.&nbsp; We knew that this was a delicate situation 
							and were looking for ways to respect the returning 
							teaching artists and the ground work they had laid, 
							while inviting the new teaching artists in to 
							feeling a part of this community.&nbsp; Based on a summit 
							of Education Directors, Edie Demas, Director of 
							Education, came back with an idea of Shared 
							Values.&nbsp; </font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Taking Edie’s 
							experience, we developed training sessions that 
							spanned over the course of two days with our 
							teaching artist community.&nbsp; First the Education 
							Staff offered 5 values that spoke to what we 
							thought, the program tries to accomplish in the 
							classroom.&nbsp; Individuals were asked to gravitate 
							toward the value that spoke the loudest to them.&nbsp; 
							The groups were instructed to deconstruct what this 
							value looks like in action. Second step was to build 
							a moving tableau or scene with a slogan for the 
							value. Lastly, we were given an abundance of 
							materials to create a visual component to the moving 
							tableau for the value. Through this process, we 
							struggled, toiled, played, laughed, discussed and 
							essentially bonded together. By the last hour of the 
							5, we were left with 6 strong values with carefully 
							crafted language structure. In the end, we decided 
							to call them our Guiding Principles.&nbsp; We used 
							this process for the basis of our presentation at 
							the conference.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">In previous Americans 
							for the Arts Conferences, there was an Arts 
							Education Pre-Conference.&nbsp; This year, the conference 
							is broken out into 7 different tracks to explore the 
							inner workings of each specific area of the arts.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Fully integrated into 
							the conference, the Arts Education Track focused on advocacy, professional development for teachers, 
							arts integration and education systematic changes. 
							Sessions were based on innovative models, advanced 
							practices, trends in the field and sessions that 
							included all three. Other tracks were, Civic 
							Engagement, Economic Development, Leadership, 
							Private-Sector, Public Advocacy, and Public Art.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Even though participants 
							had the flexibility to move from session to session 
							within any of the tracks, I chose to remain in the 
							Arts Education sessions. I thought it was important 
							to get a deeper sense of the work that other 
							organizations do in order to gain a larger 
							perspective on my programs at The New Victory 
							Theater. There were a total of 22 sessions offered 
							in the Arts Education track. For those Arts 
							educators who did attend sessions outside of the 
							track, I believe it was an important choice as, we 
							in the Arts Education Track and Field must have a 
							better understanding of all sides of the arts in 
							order to fully utilize its power in educational 
							settings. </font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Having presented and 
							attended Arts Education specific conferences, this 
							was the first time I had presented at a conference 
							with such a large forum of participants, who 
							represent every sector of the arts, specifically 
							important figures in the Arts Education field. Edie, 
							Michael Wiggins, New Vic Teaching Artist and I 
							presented, Teaching Artists and Shared Values: An 
							Approach to Building a Community of Arts Educators. 
							As we were planning for the session, we knew it 
							would be very difficult to conflate the 5 hour 
							experience into an hour and a half.&nbsp; But it was 
							important that we gave the participants a genuine 
							opportunity to go through a similar process. </font>
							</p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">We offered our current
							Guiding Principles, and asked them to select 
							one that spoke to them.&nbsp; Those groups brainstormed 
							what their principle looked like in action, created 
							a short hand term for it or slogan, and built a 
							tableau of the principle.&nbsp; From a presenter’s point 
							of view, it had been beautiful to watch my New Vic 
							Teaching Artists struggle with, get involved in and 
							ultimately become invested in our values.&nbsp; However, 
							to watch a room of complete strangers engage in the 
							values the way they did could not have been 
							predicted.&nbsp; They dove right in, chewed on them, 
							talked about them and completely got lost in the 
							values.&nbsp; The sharing was so deep that we could have 
							stayed in that room for another 3 hours.&nbsp; By the end 
							of the session, each of those groups was their own 
							little community that fed into a larger pool of arts 
							educators.&nbsp; The sessions and the participant’s 
							investment truly validated that we are doing good 
							work with our arts educator team. It also encouraged 
							me to continue to delve into these Guiding 
							Principles to see where else they can take the 
							teaching staff as a collective to deepen the 
							partnerships we are building with our schools.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">We explained to the 
							participants, that from the beginning of the fall 
							2006 and throughout the entire 06/07 season, we used 
							our principles to develop our workshop lesson plans, 
							activated the lesson plans with the whole group and 
							then identified successes and potholes based on the 
							principles.&nbsp; Last step was to make modifications to 
							ensure that we had successfully represented our 
							guiding principles in each and every plan.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">This idea of shared 
							values or a common vocabulary permeated many of the 
							conference sessions and my thoughts for the rest of 
							the weekend. As the conference continued, the big 
							puzzle was becoming clearer to me.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I attended Motivating 
							the English Language Learner through Drama with 
							Lenore Blank Kelner, Director, InterAct Story 
							Theatre. The system expects foreign language 
							speakers to be proficient in English within one 
							year, when it takes 5 – 7 years to fluent in any 
							language other than your first language.&nbsp; In this 
							session, we looked at very specific ways to 
							integrate theater activities with literature that 
							reinforce words, terms, sentence structure, through 
							physical, visual, rhythmic activities. This was 
							presented to us in a manner that was experiential 
							and informative.&nbsp; It reminded me that the value of 
							working in a classroom where art is at the heart of 
							the work can really reach students who are learning 
							English.&nbsp; </font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I also attended, 
							Aesthetic Education in the Age of Assessment: 
							Designing for Outcomes that Sustain our Work 
							with Scott Noppe-Brandon, Executive Director and 
							Jerry James, Teaching Artist, Lincoln Center 
							Institute.&nbsp; These gentlemen focused on their 
							Capacities, which help teacher and teaching artists 
							build student outcomes in their curriculum.&nbsp; Again, 
							I thought, it is so imperative that a group or 
							organization of arts educators have a shared common 
							goal and a shared vision for accomplishing that 
							goal.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">In a luncheon, Keynote 
							Speaker, Lyn Heward, President of Creative Content 
							for Cirque du Soleil, delivered a speech entitled, The Spark: Igniting the Creative Fire that Lives 
							Within Us All.&nbsp; She spoke intensely about the 
							company’s Doors for their creative process in 
							building a show.&nbsp; As I sat mesmerized by the video 
							clips of absolutely amazing artistry and listened to 
							impassioned speech, I couldn’t help but realize that 
							this was their shared values!&nbsp; Not only that, but 
							their Doors were so incredibly close to our Guiding 
							Principles.&nbsp; We have developed a creative way of 
							working for arts education curriculum that emulates 
							the artistic development process for productions. 
							This was completely mid-blowing.&nbsp; I was completely 
							inspired to continue to build on our Guiding 
							Principles that have set us on a path of deepening 
							the way we create together and the way we work in 
							the classroom.&nbsp; </font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Another highlight of the 
							conference for me was the MetLife Foundation 
							National Arts Forum Series: The Role of Arts 
							Education in Lifelong Productivity.&nbsp; This forum 
							combined the Public Advocacy and Arts Education 
							tracks to listen to an interview with Sir Ken 
							Robinson focused on arts education and the new 
							workforce.&nbsp; His ideas were not radical or vastly 
							different from what we’ve heard before, but it was 
							great to hear them. In addition to being followed by 
							a panel of respondents on the upcoming work force 
							and arts education.&nbsp; They represented Arts Education 
							Advocates from around the country that are 
							specifically doing work to develop a systematic 
							change in their states. Again, looking at a common 
							ground for why arts education should be apart of 
							these systems.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Having been fortified by 
							Lyn, Sir Ken and all the others, I encountered so 
							far during this conference, I knew I had to attend 
							the following session. Teaching Artists: 
							Developing the Profession, with David 
							Marshall, Education Department Manager, 
							Massachusetts Cultural Council, Dale Davis, 
							Executive Director, Association of Teaching Artists, 
							Lisa Donovan, Assistant Professor and Division 
							Director, Creative Arts in Learning, Lesley 
							University.&nbsp; We were asked to place ourselves into 
							the future (2012) and discuss what Teaching Artists 
							have now, then look back at 2007 and what Teaching 
							Artists had then.&nbsp; Third step was to discuss how we 
							moved from the 2007 to the present (2012).&nbsp; Lastly, 
							did we forget anything?&nbsp; During this hour and a 
							half, my eyes were opened to a point that I 
							discovered my long running focus is to develop the 
							teaching artist profession to a point where no one 
							will ever ask, “What is a teaching artist?” 
							Essentially the session facilitators asked the group 
							to decide on a shared common ground for what 
							teaching artists deserve, how they should be valued, 
							such as pay rates, insurance, job expectations, 
							different kinds of professional development programs 
							for teaching artists, in addition to opportunities 
							for growth within organizational settings. I was 
							electrified by considering how to put all of this 
							thinking into action.&nbsp;</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">With all of these 
							connections happening for me: Guiding Principles, 
							sparking the creative fires, capacities, shared 
							values and professionalizing a profession, I must 
							refer to a disconnect that occurred during the 
							conference. There were plenty of opportunities built 
							into the conference to network.&nbsp; In the case of the 
							Emerging Leaders Network, there was a social aspect 
							to gather at a local bar to meet and greet and as 
							well as two early morning sessions.&nbsp; The Emerging 
							Arts Educator Leaders’ meeting was separate from all 
							the other Emerging Leaders in the Arts.&nbsp; In this 
							meeting, we were asked by the Americans for the 
							Arts, how could they better support building our 
							leadership skills?&nbsp; I was unsure how to answer this 
							question for several reasons: First, I felt that we 
							were being ostracized from the larger forum rather 
							than being fully embraced by the network.&nbsp; 
							Therefore, I was very unclear about the kind of 
							support they have offered to the Emerging Leaders 
							prior to this.&nbsp; Another reason I was unsure how to 
							answer this question, despite the strength of the 
							question, this group was not able to fully explore 
							the possibilities of the challenge. When I believe 
							this network could provide opportunities for people 
							like myself, who have a higher education, and 5 – 10 
							years of experience in the arts, to get the support 
							we need to sustain the good work we strive to do.
							</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">However, there were 
							approximately 25 people in the room and less than 
							half matched the qualities of an emerging leader I 
							spelled out earlier.&nbsp; There were many Executive 
							Directors and Education Directors, who absolutely 
							require support from an organization like Americans 
							for the Arts.&nbsp; However, the conversation was skewed 
							based on the demographics in the session. </font>
							</p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I have never been posed 
							with such a question: What can we do to better 
							support building your leadership skills? &nbsp;I 
							would like to answer it now.&nbsp; Just like we were 
							looking at developing the teaching artist 
							profession, we need to invest time and effort into 
							the next generation of emerging artistic leaders.&nbsp; 
							In a field that can be demoralized, dismissed and 
							disregarded, we must band together to say we are 
							capable, we are real and we are in control.&nbsp; The 
							only way we can ensure that the house continues to 
							get built on the foundation laid down by incredibly 
							fine leaders, is by investing in the emerging 
							leaders.&nbsp; designing professional development&nbsp; that 
							share all the knowledge possible about how to grow 
							programs, supervise staff, build communities or 
							ensembles within an organization or within the 
							populations the organizations work with.&nbsp; I use the 
							word invest, just like we use that word with the 
							Federal government about our young people in this 
							country.&nbsp; If we want the arts to thrive, it will 
							only do so, if the leaders at the forefront, take a 
							look at who is supporting them, the assistants, the 
							associates, the apprentices or interns, and the 
							managers who work hard because they believe in this 
							work and believe they have something to offer the 
							field at large.&nbsp; As a representative for all of 
							these emerging leader, I say our challenges and 
							successes may have different flavors, but they look 
							the same. It is imperative that Americans for the 
							Arts convenes all representatives from the arts in 
							network meeting, and engages all of us to learn from 
							each other and from our leaders.</font></p>
							<p>
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Overall, I know now, 
							more than ever how important it is to start from a 
							place of common ground.&nbsp; We all need to see the big 
							picture to make connections with each other and with 
							our constituents. My charge to myself, is seek more 
							support as an emerging leader, to band together with 
							others like me within New York City and throughout 
							the nation and to focus my energy on developing the 
							teaching artist profession.&nbsp; There was no way to 
							understand what kind of impact the American for the 
							Arts conference 2007 would have on me, but now I am 
							sure I am passionate, I have a voice and I am a 
							leader.</font></p>
