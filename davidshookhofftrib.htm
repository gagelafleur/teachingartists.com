				near<br>
				Please cast a spell and lend an ear<br>
				For quite an honor is bestowed<br>
				To a great man who is much owed<br>
				He's mentor, mensch, and educator<br>
				And quite the best administrator<br>
				He's gone the distance, a marathoner<br>
				That's why he's earned our highest honor<br>
				With Olympic feats the man doth grapple<br>
				Hence not bronze nor silver, but&nbsp;Golden Apple&nbsp;<br>
				Like Camelot in that great fable<br>
				He's&nbsp;King Arthur&nbsp;of the Arts Roundtable<br>
				His kingdom's huge but has a hub<br>
				It's called Manhattan Theater Club<br>
				From two top schools the man doth hail<br>
				He went to Stanford and to Yale<br>
				But&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;is where he lives&nbsp;<br>
				He never takes and always gives<br>
				His reach is what we here applaud<br>
				Because the man’s a demi-god<br>
				So let us all now raise a glass<br>
				To the great man who’s full of class<br>
				Both now and before<br>
				Each career took off<br>
				We emulate David Shookhoff</font></div>
