									<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Glenn McClure is a composer and Arts Integration
                        Consultant. His compositions have enjoyed a wide
                        audience in the US. His acclaimed “Kyrie” from St.
                        Francis in the Americas: A Caribbean Mass was featured
                        at Carnegie Hall in New York City by the National Youth
                        Choir and at Lincoln Center by the Young People’s
                        Chorus of New York City.&nbsp; Glenn McClure’s main
                        compositional interest lies in the mixing of classical
                        music with ethnic music traditions. His work is
                        published by Earthsongs (<a href="http://www.earthsongsmus.com">www.earthsongsmus.com</a>)
                        of Corvallis, Oregon.&nbsp; Many of his compositions
                        have been born out of community initiatives and
                        collaborations.&nbsp; Glenn McClure is also a passionate
                        advocate for the integration of the Arts into the
                        education of children. He offers 500-600 concerts and
                        workshops annually that animate a variety of areas of
                        learning with hands-on musical activities. His award
                        winning work in designing and implementing these
                        programs in both mainstream and special education
                        environments continues to gain the attention.&nbsp; To

                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Another day of balancing current programs with
                        proposals for future work. I am dropping a commission
                        proposal in the mail today to the Amercian Composers
                        Forum. I regularly search for grants opportunities and,
                        all too often, I discover them only days before the
                        deadline. I was able to turn this application around
                        quickly because of the grant writing system we have in
                        my office. I normally have to concentrate on the grant
                        narrative, so we have some files filled with support
                        materials. Since most grants need similar materials
                        (resumes. bios, work samples, press clippings, program
                        evaluations, Arts lesson plans, etc.)we keep a large
                        supply on hand. I have several versions of my resume
                        already set up to fit the relatively predictable
                        catagories of information needed by most grants. I also
                        keep a list of generic recommendation letter written by
                        trusted colleagues that can be quickly inserted into an
                        application if there is not enough time to get a
                        tailored letter written. With this completed, I am
                        returning to work on my NYFA project. This year, the
                        Middle School of Mt. Morris, NY received an award for a
                        20 residency(we are currently about 10 days into the
                        residency). I am working with the 7th and 8th grade and
                        their Science Teacher Brian Lewis to explore rainforest
                        ecology. As students learn about the plants, animals,
                        nutrient cycles, etc. of the rainforest, they work with
                        me to create a new composition that reflects their
                        knowledge. Students are used to responding to curriculum
                        by writing essays, taking tests, or drawing visual
                        pictures. Since this is a musical composition project, I
                        lead the students through the process of describing the
                        rainforest with sound. They have chosen instruments from
                        the orchestra to represent the plants, animals, etc. of
                        the rainforest. The motion of these sounds reflects the
                        relationships between these members of the rainforest
                        ecosystem. The final piece will be performed in May 2003
                        by the Buffalo Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and the Mt.
                        Morris Middle School Steel Drum Band.&nbsp; This project
                        has been one of the best projects of my 14 years in the
                        field of Arts Integration. The team teaching with Brian
                        Lewis has been very exciting. This project is the most
                        sophisticated effort of 4 years of working with this
                        teaching team. By continually building our program, my
                        artist residencies have become a regular part of the Mt.
                        Morris School culture. The students have done an
                        excellent job in describing the rainforest with sound.
                        The overall outline that emerged from the first
                        residency day included a four-part Cuban drumming
                        pattern that represents the four layers of the
                        rainforest. After identifying this rhythm, one student
                        suggested that we give this rhythm to the string section
                        of the orchestra. Since strings usually play
                        lyrical/melodic gestures, the student thought that a
                        great deal of interest could be generated by giving the
                        strings a &quot;hot rhythmic pattern.&quot; The piece
                        gradually builds by adding on layer at a time. The
                        students wanted to make an artistic statement about
                        their concern and fear for the loss of rainforests to
                        human encroachment. Their idea was wonderful. Once the
                        whole orchestra is pulsating with this four part rhythm,
                        an abrasive, nasty, metallic sound is introduced to
                        represent the destruction of the rainforest by humans.
                        Every time this sound is played, one layer of the rhythm
                        is eliminated until the piece ends in stark silence.
                        This dramatic gesture will leave the audience stunned. I
                        am very proud of the ideas generated by the students. In
                        addition to this broad outline, there will be many
                        interesting details that will describe other elements of
                        rainforest ecology. Since the first draft of the piece
                        is done, I am beginning to meet with students in small
                        groups to edit this first draft. For more information on
                        the other projects that I am working on, see my web site
