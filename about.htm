							The Association of Teaching Artists (ATA), the 
							oldest, independent organization&nbsp;serving Teaching 
							Artists in the country, is a practitioner led 
							international network and community of practice that 
							champions and supports artists who&nbsp;work in education and in 
							community venues.&nbsp;<span style="color:#333333">The 
							Association of Teaching Artists (ATA) was founded at 
							a summit in Poughkeepsie, New York in April 1998. 
							New York State Teaching Artists, arts 
							administrators, and leaders in statewide arts 
							funding came together at the request of The New York 
							State Council on The Arts to consider the need and 
							feasibility of forming an organization of Teaching 
							Artists. The artists summit group met again in June 
							1998 in Troy, New York and developed and adopted a 
							mission statement, goals, and the name of the new 
							organization. ATA was incorporated in September 1998 
							and officially introduced to the New York State Arts 
							Education field at the annual statewide Arts 
							Education conference in October 1998. Dale Davis, 
							one of the founding Teaching Artists at the 1998 
							summit and former Board President of ATA, became 
							ATA’s first Executive Director in 2006. In 2010 with 
							the encouragement and support of Teaching Artists 
							and arts education professionals throughout the 
							country, ATA reached out to form a national network 
							and community of practice and strengthened its reach 
							with a national Board of Directors. Now&nbsp;in its 
							eighteenth&nbsp;year, ATA continues to pioneer serving 
							Teaching Artists.</span></span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span></p>

							Teaching Artists (theater artists, visual artists, 
							writers, filmmakers, poets, video artists, 
							photographers, media artists, dancers, storytellers, 
							musicians, puppeteers) &nbsp;work alone and in isolation 
							from a national community of practice to bring them 
							together to share the excitement and challenges of 
							their work, ideas, concerns, their history, and 
							resources. Teaching Artists work as employees of 
							arts organizations, on rosters of arts 
							organizations, and as independent contractors. They 
							work in schools, libraries, prisons, jails, juvenile 
							detention facilities, hospitals, museums, homeless 
							shelters, cultural organizations, senior citizen 
							centers, settlement houses, and community agencies 
							in urban, suburban, and rural areas in densely 
							populated and sparsely populated states. ATA 
							brings&nbsp;these diverse Teaching Artists together into 
							a practitioner led national community through its 
							listserv, Facebook page, and website&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.teachingartists.com/">www.teachingartists.com</a>. 
							ATA creates a national community through sharing 
							information Teaching Artists want to know to assist 
							them professionally, employment opportunities, 
							artists’ residencies and retreats, promising 
							approaches in arts education, evidence based 
							information on how the arts spark a passion for 
							learning, professional journals, the business of 
							working as a Teaching Artist, the arts and social 
							justice movement, constantly updated resources, 
							professional development opportunities, sharing what 
							is going on in different parts of the country. &nbsp;ATA 
							keeps in touch with the pulse of Teaching Artists.&nbsp;</span></p>

							Teaching Artists in education and in their

							grants, foundations, and individual donations. ATA 
							believes in sharing information to teach, to learn,
