                        			<span style="font-size: 11pt">In the economy of the 21st
                        Century, companies will pay their employees to think and communicate
                        effectively.&nbsp; Throughout
                        the United States school administrators are being told,
                        “Teach your students to think for themselves and
                        communicate with others.&nbsp;
                        Anything else they need to know, we will teach
                        them.”&nbsp; A
                        close friend of mine, a rear admiral in the Navy, says
                        the same thing about what the services look for in their
                        young men and women.&nbsp;
                        He wants sailors who are not afraid to use
                        initiative and think on their feet.&nbsp; The military has mastered instruction - such as how to take
                        apart and put back together the engine for an F-14. They
                        instruct teenagers to do it and do it well. If you want
                        to simply deliver curriculum you even can do it
                        online.&nbsp; But
                        to teach, to develop skills of imagination and
                        communication, you need .......... a&nbsp;
                        teacher.
                        A teacher who is familiar with both areas - some one
                        just like you. </span> </p>
                        <p style="mso-pagination:none">
						<span style="font-size: 11pt">The economy of the 21st.
                        Century rewards innovation and unexpected outcomes, but
                        present educational policy promotes a system and an
                        assessment protocol that focuses on predetermined
                        outcomes.&nbsp; In
                        the words of Tom Vander Ark of the Bill and Melinda
                        Gates Foundation, “We’ve got it all wrong.” This
                        country’s educators, children, parents......society
                        itself, desperately needs what Teaching Artists can do.&nbsp; The previous paradigm of the industrial model of education is
                        no longer appropriate to what kids and teachers require . 
						</span> </p>
                        			<span style="font-size: 11pt">Why?&nbsp;
                        In the economy of the 21st Century
                        first world societies (e.g. in North America, Europe,
                        Japan, etc.), employers will depend upon those who can imagine,
                        create and communicate.
                        Think of almost any well paying field now or in the
                        future.&nbsp; Law,
                        medicine, management, computer programming, design
                        (media or industrial), popular entertainment
                        (television, film, music), education - the list goes on.&nbsp;
                        Isn’t it true that in each one of these
                        categories you are required to imagine (a need, a
                        product, a goal, an approach), create (a solution, a
                        product, a method, a technique) and then communicate the
                        result to others in a way that they can understand and
                        buy into?&nbsp; Perhaps
                        even be moved by. </span>
									<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Isn’t this what we do every
                        day?&nbsp; Isn’t
                        this what you were trained to do - to create original
                        (i.e. unexpected) outcomes?&nbsp;
                        Well, DUH!&nbsp; But
                        don’t get too excited, because from what I’ve seen
                        out in the field, we haven’t yet made the most of our
                        skills in the critical role of preparing kids to be
                        successful in the economy of the 21st
                        Century. </span></p>
									</p>
                       				<span style="font-size: 11pt">It is my belief that we need
                        to shift our attention from some of the goals that AIE
                        practitioners have had for the past 30 years.&nbsp;
                        These goals are admirable, but our focus on them
                        has hampered our effectiveness.&nbsp;
                        Since 1973, when I first began work in this
                        field, we have, collectively, reached millions of kids,
                        in thousands of schools.&nbsp;
                        Those kids are today’s parents.&nbsp;
                        If we had been successful, those parents would be
                        demanding schools retain the arts, support the arts in
                        their communities; fill our concert halls, museums, and
                        theatres.&nbsp; Has
                        that happened?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; To cite but
                        two examples of our failure, overall government funding
                        for the arts in this country has declined 40% over the
                        past three years and less than 1% of kids who played an
                        instrument in school ever picked it up again as adults.
									</span>
									<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Let me point out at the onset
                        that we can still incorporate previous goals into a new
                        paradigm. Our past primary goals have been the
                        following:</span></p>

                  					</span>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In our idealism we gravitate
                  towards the marginalized, but in doing so we distance our work
                  from the core majority of student populations.
                  “Enrichment” therefore, has become a euphemism for
                  “non-essential.”&nbsp; Administrators
                  will tell you that only 5 to 10% of the kids in their schools
                  will probably grow up to be corrosive elements in our society,
                  but we imply that the other 90% are also in need of behavior
                  modification when we tie art activities to social reform.&nbsp;
                  And, finally, it is ironic that while knowing full well
                  that making a living as an artist is a never ending journey of
                  rejection and criticism, we promote the arts as an antidote to
                  low self-image! </span> </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Again, we can incorporate
                  these good intentions, but within a context more inclusive and
                  less paternalistic. We can base our work on a couple of very
                  basic understandings.&nbsp; To
                  be human is to be artistic. Our capacity to think in the
                  abstract (i.e. to imagine), along with our proficiency to
                  communicate in a wide variety of forms, are central to our
                  very nature.&nbsp; Taken
                  together, these characteristics have enabled the human race to
                  dominate the planet.&nbsp; It
                  is critical to develop these abilities in students because of
                  what will be required of them in the economy of the 21st
                  Century.&nbsp; Along
                  the way we can reintegrate the arts into the body of the core
                  curriculum beyond “celebratory events” such as the class
                  play, winter concert, and hallway exhibition. </span> </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">While we’re at it, we must
                  show non-arts specialist teachers how to integrate artistic
                  fundamentals in their everyday teaching so that our work is
                  not used as an excuse to eliminate
                  routine participation in artistic activity! You don’t use an
                  assembly program to teach science, or a residency to teach
                  math, or after school project to promote social studies.&nbsp;
                  There aren’t very many “teaching-scientists,” or
                  “teaching-mathematicians” peripatetically bouncing from
                  school to school being paid for by the PTA or outside funders,
                  rather than by a line item in the school board’s budget.&nbsp;
                  If we believe that the arts are basic to a child’s
                  education, we have to advocate that they be viewed in the same
                  light as “academics.” And they must be if children are to
                  succeed as adults. </span> </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Three qualities drive artistic
                  process:&nbsp; imagination,
                  self-interest, and discovery.&nbsp;
                  To create something we first imagine it.&nbsp;
                  To catalyze self-interest we invest relevance in
                  content - to include a bit of the student’s identity, world
                  view, or belief system.&nbsp; To excite a student’s participation we add the thrill of
                  discovery.&nbsp; These
                  qualities are inherent in the creation of original art work in
                  all genres. Any teacher can do it and you are just the person
                  to show them how.&nbsp; It’s
                  what we’ve been trained to do. </span> </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">To accomplish this, I suggest
                  a heresy. Perhaps, for the time being, we need to divest
                  ourselves of the Getty Foundation’s Discipline Based Arts
                  Education (DBAE) model. There is not enough room, time, staff,
                  or money to meaningfully teach any art form as a separate
                  discipline in most public school settings, much less all four
                  major ones - Dance, Theatre, Music, and Visual Art.&nbsp;
                  Kids are only in the classroom for 14% of any given
                  year’s time and schools are already overtaxed. The No Child
                  Left Behind act has made the environment even more toxic to
                  our ambitions. </span> </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">We should think more along the
                  lines of how science is taught.&nbsp;
                  Through elementary and middle school, kids are taught
                  the basics of science generally, not isolating out genetics,
                  geology, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., but to focus on
                  the broader concepts of scientific inquiry.&nbsp; The aim is not to make every kid a scientist, but to provide
                  every student a foundation which could support such an
                  ambition later, while enabling the child to have an overall
                  understanding of his or her physical environment. So it can be
                  with the arts - to better understand their social/human
                  environment. To teach The Arts, collectively, as a discipline.

                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">This means that as an actor
                  you are not teaching Acting 101 or fun-time improvisation, but
                  using your skills as an actor to provide teachers and students
                  with the ability to empathize with literary and historical
                  characters, understand the motivations of people’s behavior,
                  and develop an awareness of the power of language. Or as a
                  musician, rather than teaching notation or meter, you reveal
                  the capacity of music to elicit emotional reaction, reveal
                  elemental characteristics of your own or the composer’s
                  historical period, create aural images, and express what
                  cannot be conveyed by words alone.&nbsp;
                  In any art form, we can demonstrate generative concepts
                  such as metaphor, theme, and structure that go to the very
                  essence of how human beings evolve and communicate with one
                  another. </span> </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The artistic process is also
                  the process of making a living.&nbsp;
                  Making a living means more than making money.&nbsp;
                  Drug dealers make money, but how many junkies do you
                  see over forty five?&nbsp; They’re
                  either dead or in jail.&nbsp; Whether
                  we function as parents, spouses, or employees we are
                  constantly engaged in the creative process of
                  “solution-creation.”&nbsp;
                  To reiterate: Isn’t it true that you have to imagine
                  the essential components of a situation, problem, goal or
                  objective?&nbsp; Isn’t
                  it usually required that you have to create (think up) a
                  solution, product, plan, approach or method to address the
                  need? Isn’t also a fact that you are going to have to
                  communicate what you come up with to others in such a way that
                  they understand and buy into it?&nbsp;
                  </span>
                  </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Don’t you have to do the
                  same as a director, actor, composer, writer, designer,
                  whatever?&nbsp; Don’t
                  you have to create possible choices, analyze your resources,
                  fit within parameters, rework what you do, and effectively
                  communicate with others (actors, the director, musicians,
                  editors, scene shop/stage hands, etc.)&nbsp;
                  We are used to the process of creating original work
                  because we do it all the time.&nbsp;
                  Teachers have been trained to manufacture reproductions
                  of “the model graduate” by putting student A on an
                  assembly line with curriculum B in school/factory C to produce
                  satisfactory, efficiently measurable test results D.&nbsp;
                  However, to prepare students for their roles in the
                  economy of the 21st Century the educational system
                  will desperately need what we can provide in a new evolving
                  paradigm of education. </span> </p>
                  <p style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Participation in artistic
                  activity must be deeply satisfying and meaningful to teachers
                  and kids’ self-interest. To do this, we will need to stress
                  communication more than expression, to integrate the arts
                  collectively rather than to address each discretely, increase
                  an emphasis on achievement within specific parameters,
                  incorporate a reasonable fear of failure so that students can
                  attain a genuine sense of success, and be willing to criticize
                  sub-standard work or effort as an important tool for
                  inculcating in kids the desire to do better.&nbsp;
                  If anything will do, there is no standard.&nbsp; No standard, no sense of accomplishment.&nbsp;
                  If kids have no sense of accomplishment, there is no
                  commitment to what they’re doing.&nbsp;
                  Participation in the arts has to be more than fun, more
                  than a conduit for expression.&nbsp;
                  Expression is easy, communication much more
                  challenging. Utilizing your imagination is more difficult than
                  simply doing what you’re told. The economy of the 21st.&nbsp;
                  Century will demand much in an ever increasingly
                  competitive global environment. We are uniquely equipped to
                  prepare children for it. </span> </p>
