								<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Richard Mannoia, clarinetist, performs a wide 
								variety of orchestral, chamber, folk and new 
								music in diverse venues such as Alice Tully 
								Hall, Weill Recital Hall, Joe’s Pub, Galapagos 
								Arts Space and the Whitney Museum. A veteran 
								member of the interdisciplinary performance 
								collaborative, VisionIntoArt, he has been 
								performing new music with theater, poetry, dance 
								and film in NYC and abroad. He has been 
								freelancing in the New York area since 
								graduating from Manhattan School of Music and, 
								in addition to local performances, has performed 
								abroad extensively in countries as far reaching 
								as&nbsp;South Africa, Nepal, Serbia, and Paraguay. 
								Mannoia maintains a deep commitment to 
								educational outreach and teaches and performs 
								outreach concerts for the New York Philharmonic, 
								including performances on the Philharmonic’s 
								Asian tours to Japan and Abu Dhabi. Along with 
								bassist/composer Jon Deak, Mannoia was invited 
								by Venezuela’s renowned El Sistema to lead 
								workshops and introduce composition to the 
								Venezuelan model. Since 2007, he has been lead 
								mentor for the Fellows of the Juilliard-Carnegie 
								Hall Academy. As a consultant, Mannoia has 
								trained musicians, curated concerts and designed 
								curriculum for many organizations including the 
								Philadelphia Orchestra, New York City Opera, 
								92nd St Y, Carnegie Hall, Symphony Space and the 
								Guggenheim Museum. Since 2008, he has designed 
								and hosted the Philadelphia Orchestra’s Saturday 
								Pre-Concert Adventures in the Kimmel Center. He 
								has also taught at the Professional Performing 
								Arts High School, coached chamber music at 
								Juilliard Pre-College and coached graduate 
								chamber music at Manhattan School of Music for 
								educational outreach performances.</span></i><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

								had an innate interest in teaching and sharing 
								my knowledge and experience with kids.&nbsp; As far 
								as Teaching Artistry, it wasn’t until I was 
								recruited by Tom Cabaniss at the New York 
								Philharmonic that I really got to see a true 
								embodiment of Teaching Artistry as opposed to 
								just traditional teaching.&nbsp; The difference was a 
								fully experiential approach to learning about

								provocative inquiry.</span></font></p>

								Everyone agrees that being observed in the 
								classroom is stressful and sometimes

								perform our best while being observed.&nbsp; Despite 
								these negative feelings, receiving honest 
								feedback from an expert is invaluable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

								equipped to self-evaluate and assess in similar 
								ways to our art making training.</span></font></p>

								addition to seeking out great Teaching Artists,

								Artist career to do field observations of other 
								Teaching Artists.&nbsp; By seeing dozens of others 
								work, I was able to survey a wide variety of
