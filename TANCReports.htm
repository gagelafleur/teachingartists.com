&nbsp;<p>
						<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">No 
						Teacher Left Behind: A Practitioner’s Conference was 
						held on Friday, March 23 and Saturday, March 24 at Brown 
						University. The NTLB Conference brochure says, “We 
						believe teachers have the power to create transformative 
						experiences for their students and their schools,” and 
						the conference offered workshops and roundtables that 
						focused on arts and literacy connections, 
						content/subject area, technology, diversity, and 
						induction and retention. There were 100 presenters, 40 
						volunteers, and at least another 150 participants. The 
						NTLB Conference’s participants came from a wide range of 
						backgrounds—many teaching artists, classroom teachers 
						from New England, graduate students and academics from 
						colleges and universities, and people who run arts 
						organizations attended and presented. The NTLB 
						Conference was put together with the coordination of 
						experienced organizers. It was co-chaired by Bil 
						Johnson, Director of Social Studies/History Education in 
						the Teacher Education Program and Kurt Wootton, Director 
						of The ArtsLiteracy Project. Wootton, Johnson, Meg 
						Springer, Jori Ketten, Alexis Scott, Angela Richardson, 
						and the other organizers did a remarkable job of making 
						sure the conference ran smoothly. </font> </p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">“The conference was sponsored by both the teacher 
						education program and ArtsLiteracy for a specific 
						reason,” Wootton said. “We feel like quite a bit of what 
						is going on in our public schools these days does not 
						honor the work of creative teachers leaders. Teacher 
						leaders are educators who do things like volunteer to 
						present their work at conferences, read the latest 
						education theories and practices, stay late at night at 
						school in order to refine their lesson plans for 
						tomorrow's classes, and collaborate with colleagues in 
						dynamic ways. They are the teachers we hope we graduate 
						from our teacher education program and they are the kind 
						of teachers the ArtsLiteracy Project collaborates with 
						in pubic schools.”</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Deborah Meier’s keynote speech on Friday evening was 
						wonderful. Much of it centered around the work of Ted 
						Sizer, who was later given a lifetime achievement award. 
						Meier made many memorable statements in her speech, such 
						as, “A good school doesn’t confine us.” Part of her 
						speech zeroed in on her disgust toward the Bush 
						administration’s No Child Left Behind policy, and how 
						the current war in Iraq has been affecting students 
						here. She made this stunning assertion, as our current 
						political climate relates to education—“Lower the 
						rhetorical crisis so we can have a conversation about 
						the world.” Inversely, much of the work she has done 
						over the past several decades has been created in a 
						truly democratic spirit, and she implored audience 
						members to do the same—“Look for the metaphors that 
						capture the spirit of democracy.” One of the strongest 
						images and metaphors of Meier’s speech was “Make angel 
						wings—that’s the best a school can do.” This came at the 
						end of a story she told wherein young students were 
						walking through Central Park on a snowy day and were 
						told to stay in line, but many of them walked off the 
						path into the snow to make snow angels. This beautiful 
						metaphor also cleverly critiqued the No Child Left 
						Behind policy, which seems to have been arbitrarily 
						designed to insist on uniformity.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">After the conference was over, Wootton commented more 
						on themes that resonated with Meier’s keynote speech—“We 
						all know about the increased emphasis on testing 
						students as part of the NCLB legislation. But 
						increasingly in the last two years I've been finding 
						schools and districts have been mandating uniformity and 
						the standardization of teaching and learning at the 
						teacher level as well. Urban superintendents have been 
						emphasizing uniform scripted curriculums and programs at 
						the cost of programs that are not ‘systemic’ like ours, 
						the ArtsLiteracy Project. I've seen fantastic dance 
						programs, around for over 20 years, wiped out in one 
						year because ‘it serves only one school and not all of 
						our schools.’ Our literacy work, is not seen as 
						systemic, because it cannot be easily purchased for 
						every teacher in a district. </font> </p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">“We felt the need for, especially in today's climate, 
						honoring the work of these teachers, and creating a 
						forum for: gathering, supporting each other, and sharing 
						innovative teaching practices. The themes included areas 
						such as arts integration, technology, and diversity 
						because we wanted to challenge our thinking, as a 
						community, in these critical, rapidly changing areas in 
						the field of education,” Wootton said. </font> </p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Several times, while attending the conference, I was 
						preoccupied with a certain problem. It’s a problem that 
						conference attendees sometimes have: being confronted 
						with an overabundance of excellent choices during 
						concurrent sessions. You sit on a chair in a hallway 
						before a given session, and you circle and highlight and 
						bullet point all the sessions you’d like to attend in a 
						few minutes. It becomes a tough toss up when it comes to 
						two or more compelling sessions that happen 
						simultaneously. Here are several highlights of sessions 
						I was able to attend—</font></p>
						<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" type="disc">
							<li class="MsoNormal">
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">In the 
							“Addressing Student Literacy Through Arts 
							Integration” session, Susanne Burgess, Marissa 
							Nesbit, Joel Baxley, and Scott Rosenow from the 
							Southeast Center for Education in the Arts created 
							informative presentations on the work they’ve done 
							with young people in schools, and then Nesbit 
							facilitated an engaging and interactive movement 
							activity for the participants. </font></li>
							<li class="MsoNormal">
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">In the 
							“Intercultural Interdisciplinary Arts: An Active Way 
							To Develop Literacy” session, Alesh DuCarmo helped 
							participants work in small groups to collaboratively 
							create performed pieces that extrapolated themes 
							from folk tales.&nbsp; </font></li>
							<li class="MsoNormal">
							<font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Keith Catone, 
							founder of the New York Collective of Radical 
							Educators, facilitated a lively discussion about 
							ways by which teachers can make meaningful 
							connections with the communities in which they work 
							to deepen the impact of the work they do, during the 
							“Educator as Activist” session.&nbsp; </font></li>
						</ul>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">I’d flown into Providence from Chicago, and was 
						scheduled to facilitate a workshop based on some of the 
						work I’ve done as a teaching artist in the Chicago 
						Public Schools. This workshop would focus primarily on 
						the arts integration residencies I’ve done with poetry 
						in math and science classes—through the Center for 
						Community Arts Partnerships’ Project AIM. That was a fun 
						session, and the participants offered great ideas about 
						outside-the-box connections that can be made between 
						poetry, math and science—such as a cube-shaped poem that 
						contains haiku about numbers. </font> </p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Saturday morning’s panel discussion was great—it 
						involved Curt Columbus, from Trinity Repertory Company; 
						Donald W. King, from the Providence Black Repertory 
						Company; Laura Maxwell, from Hope High School; Ewa 
						Pyotowska, from Central Falls School District; and was 
						facilitated by Kurt Wootton. They talked about 
						partnerships that can be established between arts 
						organizations and public schools, exciting theater 
						projects that teens in Providence have developed, and so 
						on. </font> </p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">After the post-lunch workshops and roundtables, the 
						BIG NAZO puppets entertained the audience, and two 
						hilarious actors wearing giant heads with spectacular 
						noses asked random audience members about their 
						experiences, using retorts, verbal sparring, and 
						vaudeville-style musical outbursts evocative of Marx 
						Brothers schtick. A pair of green skinned monsters 
						danced around onstage. BIG NAZO was a hoot. </font> </p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">The conference’s final event was a screening of Sam 
						Lee’s amazing and moving documentary The Perfect 
						Life, which followed five students that Ms. Lee 
						taught at The Children’s Storefront School in Harlem. 
						The documentary was riveting, alternatively exultant and 
						heartbreaking. After the screening Ms. Lee fielded 
						questions about her film and the young people whose 
						stories captivated the audience.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">What will happen at next year’s No Teacher Left 
						Behind Conference? Wootton said, “We hope to have many 
						more participants at the national and international 
						level and our goal is to have Brown be a gathering point 
						for teacher leaders around the world in the future.”&nbsp;
						</font>
						</p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">Brown University has a beautiful campus. I love 
						campuses with old greystone buildings, such as those 
						found at The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (where 
						I did my undergraduate work), The University of Chicago, 
						and Brown. For me, the installation made of branches, 
						designed by Patrick Dougherty and built with the help of 
						Brown University students, that stands in front of 
						University Hall was one of the most eye-popping images 
						in Providence. It looked like a leaning jumble of wicker 
						dice rooms that a tribe of giants had woven, and it 
						contrasted nicely with the surrounding buildings’ plumb 
						vertical lines. </font> </p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 11pt">It was fantastic to experience all the engaging talks 
						and sessions that facilitators had led, and the 
						networking opportunities amid veggie and fruit munchies 
						and refreshments were an added plus. I was reflecting on 
						the conference experience as I was walking up Prospect 
						Street back to my rented car. Soon I’d be driving to my 
						aunt Ruth, uncle Dave, and cousin Sarah’s home in 
						Boston. That walk was like a mini-walk through 
						history—there were so many striking old buildings, and 
						it seems that many of them had historical landmark 
						status. Piles of snow were on the sidewalks from the 
						snow that Providence had gotten the week before. I kind 
						of felt like making a snow angel but there wasn’t enough 
						snow left to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
