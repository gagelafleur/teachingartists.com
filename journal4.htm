						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">The
                        arts offer many things to the educational process.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They shed an especially strong light on the process of
                        learning, particularly when the focus is on who manages
                        the learning process.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">Teaching
                        and learning have traditionally followed a hierarchy:
                        the teacher drove the process regarding what was
                        learned, when and how it was presented and how it was
                        determined that the expected learning took place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>Students/learners were involved in the process as
                        subordinate, accomplishing the learning put before them,
                        or sometimes not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </span>Teaching artists, faculty, administrators and
                        parents have come to value the arts as a
                        teaching/learning tool for many reasons, a primary one
                        being that it diffuses the traditional hierarchy that
                        exists within structured learning and activates casual
                        learning.<o:p>
                        </o:p>
                        </span></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">Shortly
                        after 9/11, I was asked to work intensively on the
                        development of a new project.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Grass-roots in its orientation, it was driven forward
                        by artists as an effort to utilize the creative process
                        to promote healing during times of crises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </span>As we began to organize and plan programming,
                        ArtistCares took a hard look at why the creative process
                        was valuable not only in the context of learning, but
                        especially in the context of healing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>(It was obvious early on that the health care
                        arena shared the same structure as the educational
                        arena: services occurred in a hierarchical manner with
                        the patient being on the receiving end.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </span>Because the arts have a history of effectiveness
                        within the healthcare community, and because many
                        teaching artists were drawn to ArtistCares early on, we
                        explored the literature regarding the ways the creative
                        process functioned in a healing context.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">What
                        emerged is a parallel between both education and health
                        care regarding the role of the learner using the
                        creative process in both of these arenas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </span>The creative process is dynamic and effective in
                        these arenas because a powerful shift occurs for the
                        learner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
                        have identified it as participant driven learning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>Put simply, the teacher or healthcare provider
                        become facilitators within the process, giving learners
                        the power of driving the process forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>In this learning paradigm, the learner decides
                        what, how and when learning occurs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>The learner controls the pace, the content and
                        the dynamic embedded in the learning process.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">While
                        designing a workshop that would enable artists to step
                        into the facilitating process, we consulted with a CEO
                        from the corporate world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>In her work, Yvette Hyater-Adams has developed
                        two models that describe the learning process when it is
                        driven not by the teacher,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>but by participants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>In a linear model, the learner progresses from
                        unconscious incompetence to unconscious competence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>This four-phase process can be compared to
                        learning how to ride a bike; each phase builds on the
                        ability of the previous phase -- the twist being the
                        conscious awareness that the learner has regarding
                        progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
                        we do not know that we do not know something, questions
                        can’t be asked that will alleviate the condition of
                        not knowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
                        we know that we don’t know, we can actively,
                        consciously change our unknowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>When we “know”, we can also move to the place
                        where we achieve an unconscious competence; deep ability
                        within the specific skill or content.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">In
                        a second model, learning occurs in a cyclical fashion,
                        spiraling upward through each cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>Beginning with experiencing the activity, the
                        cycle includes sharing reactions, processing patterns,
                        generalizing principles and applying the new learning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>It is also based on a conscious awareness of each
                        phase, but unlike the more linear model, the phases of
                        this model are often experienced in a less rigorous
                        progression.</span></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">Each
                        model gives facilitators ways of recognizing different
                        stages of learning; knowledge that can support the
                        efforts of facilitators in functioning as a guide for
                        participants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
                        we’ve found in participant-driven learning is that the
                        focus and responsibility of motivation rest solely with
                        participants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
                        have recognized that our role as facilitators usually
                        wanes once participants reach the stage that they <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">know
                        they don’t know.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>Conscious incompetence has a natural forward
                        motivation embedded within – it is the point where you
                        let go of the bicycle and trust the rider will not
                        crash, but find themselves in the middle of a beautiful
                        balance.<o:p>
                        </o:p>
                        </span></p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
						<span style="font-size:11pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;">When
                        I work as a teaching artist (visual arts), participant
                        driven learning is an integral part of the classroom
                        dynamic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
                        I begin a residency, I talk with the classroom teacher
                        about the students “driving their own cars”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>I describe what participant-driven learning is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>Once we reach an agreement, I also talk to the
                        students about this idea and suggest that for the time
                        we work together, that will be an emphasis: giving them
                        the opportunity to “drive their own cars” during the
                        art-making process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>This means they make choices and key decisions

                        generally describe art making as the relationship of
                        process and idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
                        students, teacher and I might examine some artwork
                        (actual or through reproduction) and notice how this
                        relationship is embedded in the art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                        </span>Then, through their creative work, students
                        construct and navigate a relationship between process
                        and idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each
                        person creates a unique understanding of this

                        person navigates the relationship in his or her own way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

                        aspects as well as providing the support they need to
                        engage both allows them to own this process and drive it
                        forward at will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
                        also choose at what level their idea is rooted to and
                        resonates with their intellect, personality, emotional
                        and spiritual self.</span></p>
