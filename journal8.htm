                    </b><span style="font-size: 11pt"><br>
                    I reflect on being a Teaching Artist with a smile on my face
                    and in my heart. God blessed me, and I have had the
                    perseverance to now have a successful career in dance. For
                    fifteen years I have worked with several arts
                    institutes—the Central New York Institute for Aesthetic
                    Education, Partners for Arts Education, the Central New York
                    Community Arts Council, the Southern Tier Institute—and I
                    have touched thousands of school children. Not only were the
                    children prepared to see and understand live performance,
                    but they experienced the expression of human spirit through
                    dance. I was rewarded with appreciation and intelligent
                    questions that reflected the children’s understanding and
                    knowledge of what they had experienced in follow-up visits.<br>
                    <br>
                    Involvement as a Teaching Artist over the years has given me
                    the opportunity to be touched by students in a very special
                    way. When I have been approached by young adults—high
                    school age and older—with a, “Mrs. Mitchell, do you
                    remember me?” I look into the beautiful faces and think
                    where do I know this person from. The young adults continue,
                    “You came to my school and did . . . “ The memories
                    flood back, and I smile with my face and my heart.<br>
                    <br>
                    Lately though I have been haunted by the knowledge that some
                    of those young people that I helped open to the world of
                    aesthetics are now faced with death and destruction as our
                    world is gripped in conflict and war. Some of these
                    “kids” may be soldiers in the midst of some ugly
                    situations. Will they remember there is good, that life can
                    be beautiful? As a Teaching Artist I take pride in
                    contributing something good, in touching people’s lives,
                    in helping people see the world a little differently and
                    knowing that I influenced them in some small way to become
                    productive citizens.<br>
                    <br>
                    My smile broadens with memories. I love being a Teaching
                    Artist.</span><p>&nbsp;</p>
