								<i>Lauren Atkinson is a founding member and

								education program<b> </b>in Seattle, Washington 
								established in 2000. She has served as Faculty 
								Development Manager from 2005-2010, and in this 
								role she worked closely with a faculty of thirty 
								Teaching Artists from multiple disciplines, 
								overseeing curriculum and professional 
								development. She has worked with many arts 
								education programs in the Pacific Northwest 
								including Seattle Public Schools, Arts Impact, 
								Principals Project, Centrum Education, the 
								Seattle Center Academy, the Seattle Children’s 
								Museum and Power of Hope. Her creative practice 
								has evolved and developed over a 20-year period 
								as a collaborative visual artist and Teaching 
								Artist working with people of all ages and 
								backgrounds. Lauren Atkinson’s work is grounded 
								in the power of learning by doing. Her role as a 
								teacher is that of a “bridge,” extending her 
								hand to support each individual’s own way of 
								being and seeing.&nbsp; She believes each of us 
								learns in a unique way, and she emphasizes the 
								dynamic reciprocal relationship between teacher 
								and student.&nbsp; </i></font></p>
