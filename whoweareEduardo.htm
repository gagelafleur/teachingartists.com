								<span style="font-size: 11pt">In 1982 I was hired to teach Arts Education in a 
								public school in Brazil. It was a 5<sup>th</sup> 
								- 8<sup>th</sup> grade night program and the 
								legal age to be enrolled was 14 years old. I was 
								younger than most of my students. There was no 
								motivation to learn in the whole school. 
								Students had low performance and terrible 
								academic results. Teachers were tired after a 
								long day teaching in other schools and adding 
								the nighttime job as second job to increase 
								their income. In the same way most of students 
								had hard jobs, low payment, and lived in local 
								shantytowns. The teachers complained and several 
								students slept in the classroom. </span></font> </p>

								<font face="Verdana">
								<span style="font-size: 11pt">By listening to both, faculty and students, I 
								completely changed the way I taught. Since I had 
								studied Augusto Boal techniques I applied what I 
								learned from them in the classroom and broke 
								down quarters, applying geometry separately (to 
								support Visual Arts and Math), Visual Arts, 
								Music and Theater. I tried to pair up with the 
								rest of the faculty to integrate arts with their 
								subjects, but my idea was rejected because 
								teachers thought it was just one more thing to 
								add to their stress of teaching in that night 
								program. However, the Portuguese teacher wanted 
								to give a try. </span></font> </p>

								<p style="text-autospace: none; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
								<font face="Verdana">
								<span style="font-size: 11pt">I started by changing the way the desks were 
								placed in the classroom. I asked students to 
								tell me the stories in their communities, what 
								happen that day on the way to work or on the way 
								to school. I built my curriculum based in their 
								reality. I used the last two quarters to partner 
								with the Portuguese teacher. The quarter before 
								the last the content was music. I divided each 
								class into small groups and each group worked on 
								an original composition by anyone in the class 
								or they composed from someone they know from 
								their community. For my deadline lyrics were 
								brought into the classroom, and we talked about 
								the content without mentioning grammar or 
								writing styles. The music quarter ended with a 
								music contest for whole school and open to the 
								community. </span></font> </p>

								<span style="font-size: 11pt">The last quarter was theater. This was the most 
								exciting quarter because the students built the 
								sets applying what they learned in visual arts. 
								The planned the production thinking the way we 
								plan and think logically when we apply geometry. 
								They used their own music and performed plays 
								they wrote using stories they created in the

								course).</span></font></p>

								<span style="font-size: 11pt">As a result, the culture of the school changed. 
								The students demonstrated motivation at the
