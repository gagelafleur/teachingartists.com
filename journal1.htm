                      </span>Generally this means starting at least a day or so
                      ahead to pre mix and dye cotton fibers to make easy to use
                      pulp for students who will be creating large scale
                      paper-art projects in the class room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                      </span>If I’m doing a more introductory workshop, I
                      prepare some, but also let the kids prepare their own
                      paper pulp by recycling colorful scrap papers in the
                      blenders I bring to the class room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                      </span>Then there are the deckle (forming) boxes, tubs,
                      draining trays, sponges, hand towels, etc. for 10 work
                      stations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As

                      library of books and materials related to paper making and
                      paper history from around the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                      </span>Occasionally, as I lug the last of at least 6 large
                      boxes down the stairs from my studio and cram it in to my
                      car, I wonder <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

                      always what I expect it to be.&nbsp; A couple of years ago
                      I had a bus load of second graders come to my studio on a
                      field trip to spend a morning learning about papermaking.&nbsp;
                      We met in the studio and did introductions, then each of
                      them received a cookie and a paper cup of juice and we
                      went to the room next door and sat on the floor to see
                      slides and ask questions.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Afterwards, we returned to the studio
                      for a couple of hours and made many colorful sheets of
                      paper with the help of the bus driver, their classroom
                      teacher, and myself.&nbsp; The kids were thoroughly
                      involved with their projects, even to the point of
                      whimpering a little when we had to stop to clean up so
                      they could get back on the bus to return to school.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                      envelope arrived at my door.&nbsp; It was full of
                      beautifully decorated, handwritten student thank you
                      notes!&nbsp; Well, of course I was thrilled, and with
                      grand notions of my creative and artistic influence on
                      these kids I sat down to read the letters.&nbsp; Almost
                      without fail, the first line in each letter read, “Dear
                      Mrs. Vaughan, thanks for the snack!”</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                      children, or the nerves I get before a public
                      presentation, I occasionally wonder why I ever choose to
                      leave the peaceful confines of my studio.&nbsp; My studio
                      work provides me with most all the income I need, and the
                      business of being a visual artist has plenty of challenges
                      all by itself.&nbsp; So, why do I bother with arts
                      education?&nbsp; Why am I a teaching artist?</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">

                      to be.&nbsp; I was hesitant at first, but people showed me
                      there was a curiosity out there, a desire to know about
                      what I do.&nbsp; When I discovered that the love and
                      enthusiasm I have for my work could be infectious, I was
                      hooked.&nbsp; Every time I see the face of a student,
                      whether child or adult, light up in delight with the
                      simple act of creating something beautiful and tangible -
                      a small sheet of handmade paper - it reminds me of why I
                      became an artist in the first place.</span><o:p><span style="font-size: 11pt">
