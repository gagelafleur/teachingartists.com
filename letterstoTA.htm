													like a pioneer or a Johnny

													<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">I want to know: how do you 
													understand the origins of 
													your interest? Is this, for 
													you, a gig, a job, a 
													vocation, a career, a 
													calling, or a profession? Is 
													there some other way that 
													you frame your interest and 
													its wellspring?</span></p>

													<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Why do you want to do this

													<p style="line-height: normal; text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
													<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">I have posed a lot of 
													questions because my 
													learning style is grounded 
													in questioning. An integral 
													part of my artistic practice 
													as a choreographer is to 
													question myself. It follows 
													that I use questions as a 
													Socratic approach to 
													teaching and learning.</span></p>
													<p style="line-height: normal; text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
													<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">I practice “‘arts education’ 
													and ‘arts-in-education’” as 
													an interdisciplinary field. 
													My research in arts learning 
													is within what I have 
													conceptualized as a broader 
													field of experiential 
													education and the arts that 
													encompasses arts 
													education/arts-in-education. 
													I am thinking of 
													experiential education as 
													grounded in and inspired by 
													the work of Dewey, extending 
													back to the guild system of 
													the middle ages to the way 
													that earlier and ancient 
													societies regulated practice 
													of artisans, and a basic way 
													that humans know and 
													understand based in doing.</span></p>
													<p style="line-height: normal; text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
													<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">I am defining 
													interdisciplinarity as 
													bringing together into 
													dynamic interaction, at 
													least two fields or 
													knowledge domains. The 
													rationale for 
													interdisciplinary theory and 
													practice is to a) amplify 
													understanding of critical 
													issues and challenges from 
													multiple perspectives, b) 
													discover new relationships 
													beyond the constructs of 
													individual fields and 
													knowledge domains, and c) 
													construct knowledge. Three 
													fields comprise the 
													interdisciplinary field of 
													arts-in-education you seek 
													to enter, that is, a) the 
													arts; b) the particular arts 
													field you know, understand, 
													and do; and c) education.</span></p>
													<p style="line-height: normal; text-autospace: none; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
													<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Depending on the 
													practitioner, other fields 
													and domains might also 
													contribute to the 
													interdisciplinary dynamic of 
													arts 
													education/arts-in-education, 
													including intercultural 
													communication, cognitive 
													science, and psychology. The 
													other content areas of the 
													PreK-18 curriculum are also 
													potentially present in the 
													teaching artist’s 
													understanding and practice 
													and include: English 
													language arts; social 
													studies; math, science, and 
													technology; health and 
													physical education; and 
													language study other than 
													English. All art forms are 
													potentially involved, such 
													as dance, theater, music, 
													and visual arts, as well as 
													art forms that do not appear 
													explicitly as part of the 
													Learning Standards for the 
													PreK-18 public school 
													curriculum, such as, 
													creative writing; video, 
													film and animation; 
													performance art; circus 
													arts; and dance-theater.</span></p>

													<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">I hope that this line of 
													introductory inquiry has 
													helped you understand my 
													perspective as a 
													practitioner of teaching 
													artistry and as an arts 
													educator/teaching artist. 
													This reflection on 
													interdisciplinarity is 
													fundamental to how I am 
													thinking about some of the 
													theoretical and practical 
													issues that we in the U.S. 
													currently face in the fields 
													of the arts, education, and

													<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

													instruments and amps around 
													is pretty key, even with 
													kids who are primarily 
													interested in sampler-based 
													production.&nbsp; The 
													availability of live 
													instrumentation adds all 
													sorts of musical and 
													technical dimensions, and 
													the kids really gravitate to 
													the performance 
													possibilities too, even kids 
													with no prior training.
													</span></p>
													<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Multipurpose is ideal--leads 
													to interesting work. I'm 
													sure you'll find what works 
													best for you in terms of 
													curriculum.&nbsp; For me, working 
													with kids from 4-18 years 
													old, I found that what 
													worked best in most cases 
													was combining a little 
													technical/theoretical 
													teaching with a little 
													musical/aesthetic training 
													and discussion and a lot of 
													entirely student-driven 
													production work, right from 
													day one.&nbsp; </span></p>
													<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

													absorbing pretty complex 
													technical and musical skills 
													on the fly, if they are 
													interested in the work and 
													need the skills to achieve 
													the artistic outcome they've

													hypothetical 2-hour studio 
													session might look like 
													this:</span></p>

													10 minutes -- Kids, or 
													self-selected kid &quot;studio 
													manager&quot; might fire up the 
													gear.&nbsp; The rest of us might 
													sit around and bull. <br>
													<br>
													15-20 minutes -- Straight up 
													lecture demonstration on a 
													technical or musical topic.&nbsp; 
													Kids encouraged to take 
													notes, but not required to.&nbsp; 
													Topic might be anything from 
													how to coil a cable to 
													binary math, or wave 
													mechanics, notation, simple 
													music theory issues, 
													(depends on age, interests, 
													teacher expertise, etc.).&nbsp; 
													Discussion, questions and 
													argument strongly 
													encouraged.&nbsp; The vibe is 
													very de-schooled---the point 
													isn't to learn this to meet 
													some state standard or 
													prepare for some test, but 
													to learn it because a) it's 
													cool and interesting and b) 
													it's&nbsp; useful. <br>
													<br>
													10-15 minutes -- Some sort 
													of musical discussion.&nbsp; We 
													might listen to something 
													(familiar or unfamiliar 
													music, student work in 
													progress, whatever) and talk 
													about it from an engineering 
													standpoint, or a musical 
													standpoint.&nbsp; Strong opinions 
													and deep discussion 
													encouraged! <br>
													<br>
													1 hour and 15 minutes -- 
													Production work.&nbsp; Kids can 
													work individually or in 
													groups.&nbsp; My role is 
													primarily as tech support 
													and artistic provocateur.&nbsp; I 
													often hang out OUTSIDE the 
													studio during this time so 
													the kids are really forced 
													to run things by 
													themselves.&nbsp; Some kids might 
													be heavy into tracking or 
													sequencing, others might be 
													writing, others might be 
													sitting in the corner and 
													watching/critiquing/hating.&nbsp; 
													All of this is cool.&nbsp; The 
													only rules are:&nbsp; treat the 
													gear well; don't be an 
													asshole; don't get in the 
													way of the work.&nbsp; There is 
													zero tolerance for 
													censorship of any kind.&nbsp; I 
													might argue with kids about 
													the political implications 
													of some lyrics or something, 
													or even refuse to 
													participate in something I 
													find really objectionable 
													(it’s never come to that) 
													but I don't place limits on 
													expression.&nbsp; </span></p>
													<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">The issue of the school's 
													rules, culture, and my job 
													security are dealt with 
													openly, but at the 
													distribution phase--some 
													work is for some audiences 
													and some is for others.&nbsp; 
													Kids totally get this.&nbsp; If 
													the school needs a certain 
													type of work to be produced 
													for particular purposes or 
													for show, we're honest about 
													that, and it becomes similar 
													to working in a jingle house 
													(for ads)--the kids are set 
													with the task of finding 
													ways to creatively address 
													the particular challenge.&nbsp; 
													But, the emphasis is on 
													original, innovative work 
													that the students want to 
													make.&nbsp; I often tell them 
													that if less than 50% of 
													their music is 
													incomprehensible to me they 
													are doing MY work not 
													theirs. <br>
													<br>
													So, in practice there are a 
													million variations on this 
													type of sequence, and just 
													cause it works for me 
													doesn't mean it should for 
													anyone else.&nbsp; The bottom 
													line is that, if the kids 
													are working on music that 
													matters to them, and they 
													have someone around who 
													knows some things, as you 
													do, and is willing to find 
													out about things they don't 
													know, as I'm sure you are, 
													they will learn a great deal 
													and produce some really cool 
													stuff.&nbsp; They'll also have a 
													blast. <br>
													<br>
													A few thoughts on the gear 
													and curriculum: <br>
													<br>
													Sound sources are more 
													important than inputs:&nbsp; 
													if&nbsp;you have to choose 
													between a bunch of 
													instruments, some drum 
													machines and a few field 
													recorders, or a really fancy 
													multi-channel interface, go 
													for the former.&nbsp; Initially 
													most of the work the kids do 
													will be overdub based--one 
													track at a time. <br>
													<br>
													If you can get something 
													like Acid, Reason, or 
													Fruityloops (the demo is 
													free and does everything but 
													save a session--you can mix 
													down to WAV though) on a 
													bunch of beater computers, 
													kids’ laptops etc., that is 
													really useful.&nbsp; Lots of kids 
													will generate ideas, and 
													even fully worked out 
													songs/pieces just working 
													with a sequencer and an 
													onboard laptop mic.&nbsp; Tracks 
													can later be dumped to 
													pro-tools for additional 
													work, mastering etc. <br>
													<br>
													Spend more time teaching 
													craft and theory, less time 
													teaching the interface.&nbsp; 
													Kids KNOW how to figure out 
													software.&nbsp; Better to spend 
													time teaching them how a mic 
													works, and what EQ is all 
													about than how to work a PT 
													playlist.&nbsp; You can show them 
													that stuff on the fly or 
													they'll figure it out 
													themselves. <br>
													<br>
													Direct teaching should be 
													clearly organized 
													(topically, sequentially, 
													whatever), but the way the 
													kids work will have very 
													little to do with this 
													initially.&nbsp; So you'll teach 
													EQ one day, but when they 
													start back working on their 
													projects the kids will 
													ignore EQ entirely because 
													they are fascinated with 
													learning to play the drums, 
													or they've discovered the 
													reverb plug-in etc.&nbsp; A 
													common mistake that teachers 
													make is to try and make 
													these two types of learning 
													line-up.&nbsp; There is no reason 
													to, and in fact the attempt 
													to line them up gets in the 
													way of the work and annoys 
													both kid and teacher.&nbsp; What 
													you teach and what the kids 
													discover will intersect 
													organically in the work 
													itself.&nbsp; Roll with it. <br>
													<br>
													When a kid asks &quot;What do you 
													want us to do?&quot; the first 
													response should always be, 
													&quot;How should I know what you 
													want to do?&quot;&nbsp; If your goal 
													is fundamentally to get the 
													kids to frame the creative 
													and technical problems 
													themselves, and to help them 
													solve them on their own 
													terms, they will engage in 
													ways no classroom teacher 
													ever gets to see.&nbsp; The most 
													problematic kid in the 
													school will&nbsp;turn out to be a 
													genius in the studio.&nbsp; The 
													work will be incredible and 
													you'll have a blast.&nbsp; The 
													studio is not a classroom, 
													it's a studio.&nbsp; The rules 
													SHOULD be different.&nbsp; 
													Teachers and administrators 
													will&nbsp;need to get used to 
													this idea at first, but 
													if&nbsp;you explain that the kids 
													are learning different 
													skills (innovation, 
													collaboration, 
													self-organization) and they 
													see the engagement that 
													takes place, most will come 
													to understand.&nbsp; The parents 
													almost always seem to get it 
													right away because their 
													kids come home raving about 
													how much they love the 
													studio. <br>
													<br>
													Don't be afraid if a project 
													the kids start crashes and 
													burns.&nbsp; Force yourself not 
													to worry about the outcome.&nbsp; 
													Don't worry if, after three 
													weeks of hard work, the kids 
													decide they want to drop a 
													project and start a 
													different one.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do 
													these things, you'll find 
													that, as if by magic, the 
													kids will generate amazing, 
													carefully thought out, and 
													finished work.&nbsp; The less YOU 
													drive it, the more THEY will 
													make amazing music, and the 
													more they will learn. <br>
													<br>
													The one area where it's ok 
													to be really rigid and 
													almost militaristic is with 
													certain types of craft 
													procedures:&nbsp; proper handling 
													of gear, proper marking of 
													track sheets and so on.&nbsp; 
													Kids get this.&nbsp; If kids want 
													to revise procedure once 
													they know it, great, as long 
													as they can explain the 
													reasoning behind the 
													revision.&nbsp; We had a kid who 
													didn't say or do anything 
													for the first three weeks of 
													an after-school studio 
													program.&nbsp; Then one day he 
													walked in with a beautifully 
													drawn floor plan and said, 
													&quot;This studio is set up all 
													wrong--it's really hard for 
													12 of us to work in here.&quot;&nbsp; 
													He was completely right, 
													except for his monitor 
													placement, which he quickly 
													revised once we explained 
													the problem.&nbsp; He got the 
													other kids to help him move 
													all the gear and furniture 
													around to work better.&nbsp; He 
													became de facto Studio 
													Manager, which was fine.&nbsp; 
													Then he started getting off 
													a bit too much on a power 
													trip, which was fine too 
													because the kids asked if 
													they could fire him.&nbsp; I 
													said, &quot;Why are&nbsp;you asking 
													me?&quot;&nbsp; They &quot;fired&quot; him, and 
													then &quot;rehired&quot; him with a 
													changed attitude.&nbsp; It was 
													very cool, and because I 
													didn't take any of it too 
													seriously, they didn't 
													either.&nbsp; They learned a 
													little about organization, 
													but mostly they stayed 
													focused on the work. <br>
													<br>
													The earlier you can involve 
													students in the studio the 
													better.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you know there 
													are a few students who are 
													already interested, invite 
													them to a real meeting where 
													you talk about the gear 
													options, curriculum etc.&nbsp; If 
													they are really involved, 
													they will be a magnet for 
													other kids.&nbsp; It's fine for 
													kids to recruit their 
													friends and all, but insist 
													that they also recruit kids 
													they don't like, even kids 
													no one likes.&nbsp; Explain to 
													them that such a mix is 
													necessary if you want to 
													produce really interesting 
													music.&nbsp; They won't entirely 
													get this, but they will 
													later when the kid no one 
													likes is the only one who 
													seems to be able to figure 
													out how to get the Mac to 
													recognize the interface, or 
													the only one who can 
													syncopate his foot on the 
													kick drum.&nbsp; Insist that the 
													group is close to at least 
													half girls/women.&nbsp; Tell them 
													this mix is also necessary 
													for them to make really good 
													music.&nbsp; The girls always end 
													up being the best 
													technicians in addition to 
													being great musicians.&nbsp; 
													They'll end up teaching the 
													boys. <br>
													<br>
													Do not, under any 
													circumstances let the school 
													use participation in your 
													program as a reward for 
													anything, or deny 
													participation as a 
													punishment.&nbsp; This is a 
													recipe for pedagogical, 
													musical, and cultural 
													disaster, and it completely 
													undermines the positive 
													aspects of participation, 
													especially for students who 
													have a hard time in school.&nbsp; 
													If the school has to punish 
													kids they should leave the 
													studio out of it.&nbsp; I can't 
													tell you how many times I've 
													had to fight with 
													administrators because they 
													want to pull a kid out of 
													the studio program for 
													something that happened 
													elsewhere, even though that 
													kid has said time and again 
													that his work in the studio 
													is the ONLY reason he still 
													attends school. <br>
													<br>
													Ok, I suspect this seems 
													more of a rant than a help!&nbsp; 
													Take it just as one person's 
													experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have 
													specific questions about how 
													to think about curriculum, 
													let me know and I'll be 
													happy to share some ideas.&nbsp; 
													You can also hear a few 
													examples of the thousands of 
													recordings kids made in the 
													studios I worked in, here:

												and understandable lessons. It 
												is important to learn how to 
												break down the process without 
												disrupting flow, and to keep our

												Make sure you aware of their

												to imagine, to explore and 
												discover the richness of their 
												newly found understandings.&nbsp; 
												Become a part of their angle of 
												vision, watch with them the flow 
												of their dreaming, the constant 
												delights of their reaching into 
												the unknown, the spaces and 
												solitudes that make up their 
												wonder and astonishments. Let 
												yourself travel with their 
												ideas, become the adventure of 
												their inner worlds, the 
												movements and gestures of their 
												questions and answers. Enter 
												their listenings, the sheer 
												abundance of poetries 
												surrounding them. And with quiet 
												patience watch their eyes follow 
												you – as you bring them to the 
												marvel and mystery that are 
												their dances, their words, their 
												music, their drawn and painted 
												images. Then sit back and enjoy 
												their singular excitement and 
												joy, indeed their gratitude, as 
												they begin to see, to experience

												their thoughts, perhaps as it is 
												for you, at the source of 
												themselves – and the life of

												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Katie, a cherubic young actor in 
												my class, wore her long blonde 
												hair in straight braids down her 
												chest.&nbsp; In a game of “Dolphin 
												Training,” her classmates and I 
												decided to train her to hold her 
												braids up and “fly” around the 
												room.&nbsp; [This is an improv 
												training game I learned from 
												BATS in San Francisco.]</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Each time Katie touched her 
												braids, the company called out, 
												“Ding!”&nbsp; She’d let her braids 
												go, look around at what offers 
												she was making, and say, 
												“What??”&nbsp; Then, she wandered 
												about, making offers, trying to 
												figure out what she was supposed 
												to do.&nbsp; Sooner or later, Katie 
												would touch or pull at her 
												braids, and again, the company 
												would call out her reward: 
												“Ding!”</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Katie started to get really 
												frustrated.&nbsp; She wasn’t “doing 
												anything,” she complained.&nbsp; The 
												more frustrated she became, the 
												more her braid-stroking habit 
												increased.&nbsp; “Ding! Ding!” we 
												called out.&nbsp; Her habit was so 
												deeply unconscious that when she 
												finally (finally!) put two and 
												two together—that she was 
												touching her braids and getting 
												“dinged” for it--, getting her 
												to hold her braids out and run 
												around was easy.&nbsp; The look of 
												relief on her face was matched 
												only by the utter recognition of 
												her habit.<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">I thought of Katie and the 
												Dolphin Game recently, as I read 
												this lesson from F. M. 
												Alexander: “You can’t learn what 
												you don’t know, if you keep 
												doing what you do know.”&nbsp; Katie 
												was unable to be “trained” in 
												the game, because she failed to 
												even recognize what she “knew 
												how to do.”&nbsp; Habit, the great 
												deadener, eh?<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Before I can teach actors 
												anything, I find my first task 
												is to become a kind of mirror 
												for them.&nbsp; I show them what 
												they’re doing.&nbsp; I allow them to 
												recognize their habitual 
												impulses.&nbsp; I must do this as 
												gently as possible, stripping my 
												tone or my expression of any 
												judgment, so they don’t feel 
												“bad” for having practiced their 
												habits.&nbsp; I help them to slow 
												down and go easy, so the 
												habitual impulse cannot find 
												expression.&nbsp; In this way, other 
												impulses may arise, and they can 
												track those.<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">When I first fell in love with 
												Dolphin Training, I admired it 
												for the way it exercises an 
												improviser’s spontaneity and 
												listening skills.&nbsp; Improvisers 
												have to keep making offers. 
												&nbsp;Improvisers have to listen, 
												both to the feedback of the 
												audience and to their own 
												awareness.&nbsp; Improvisers learn to 
												fail good-naturedly by making 
												offers that don’t work. For many 
												reasons, I loved the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												Using the frame of Alexander’s 
												lesson, I saw the game in a new 
												light and admired it all the 
												more. <br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Being a teaching artist requires 
												us to look at our own habits 
												(and habits of mind) just as 
												much as we make our actors aware 
												of theirs.&nbsp; It’s constant 
												practice.&nbsp; It’s always new.&nbsp;

												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">So you want to be an artist who 
												actually makes a living! The 
												perfect occupation for you, 
												although you certainly won’t get 
												rich at it, is being a teaching 
												artist. I have been at this 
												work, off and on, for almost 40 
												years. This occupation, sporadic 
												and intermittent as it can be, 
												has been one of the great joys 
												in my life.</span></p>

												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">The longevity gene isn’t one you 
												require for this job; those who 
												work best in shorter, more 
												intensive spurts are ideally 
												suited to be teaching artists. 
												(I deeply admire teachers who 
												are able to work day in, day 
												out, with the same students, but 
												that’s not my strength, and I 
												suspect it’s not the strength of 
												most of us in this field.)

												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">As a teaching artist, you’ll 
												need to be really good at 
												applying for jobs because each 
												new residency is like a new job, 
												with all its frightening and 
												exhilarating aspects. You must 
												revel in intensive work with 
												different groups and enjoy the 
												challenge of meeting new 
												teachers and their students and 
												learning their quirks and 
												idiosyncrasies. This past year I 
												had two boys who always called 
												me, in their pre-teen voices, 
												“Ms. Bertha Rogers,” making me 
												laugh. One of these boys also 
												wrote the most amazing poem 
												about time, far beyond his 
												years, and I was so excited, I 
												had to read the poem over and 
												over. </span></p>

												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">You must be prepared to work 
												with students from K-12, from 
												21-106 (my oldest student, a 
												bright, articulate writer, was 
												in a nursing home; she couldn’t 
												hold the pencil, but she 
												dictated an amazing story). My 
												youngest students have been two 
												years old. Working in these age 
												ranges expands and advances your 
												own thinking process and opens 
												you to wonderful new realities.</span></p>
												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

												<p style="line-height: normal; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">You will also teach, if you’re 
												lucky enough to be in a big city 
												like New York, students of every 
												possible ethnic background, 
												which will only enrich you and 
												your thinking. If you’re working 
												in small towns you’ll understand 
												how students who attend school 
												in the same building from K-12 
												resolve differences and exult in 
												their sense of community.</span></p>

												<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana">Sometimes, you’ll be working 
												with gifted students; sometimes 
												(and often the very next day), 
												you’ll be helping special needs 
												children, or the incarcerated, 
												or retarded adults. You will 
												never be able to sleep through 
												your working days. Instead, you 
												will constantly be on the alert, 
												always learning, just like your 
												students. I was told by a very 
												famous poet that he always 
												assigned himself the same task 
												as those he gave to his 
												students, a very good device for 
												keeping fresh as a writer or 
												artist (of course, you won’t 
												have the opportunity to write or 
												draw in the classroom because 
												you’ll be so busy working with 
												the individual students; this 
												will be on your own time).</span></p>

												have to manage those on your own

												with a health plan, you probably 
												won’t have health insurance. You
