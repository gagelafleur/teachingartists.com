								holds a BFA in Dance Performance &amp; Composition

								intuitively used theater arts techniques to 
								enhance the learning process in her 
								classroom.&nbsp;After moving to Atlanta, GA, Ms. 
								Nweje served as a dance specialist in two public 
								high schools and taught for dance studios and 
								outreach programs while continuing to 
								choreograph, perform, and write. &nbsp;Her subsequent 
								work as an Atlanta Teaching Artist and 
								arts/youth development coordinator largely 
								targeted under-served populations. &nbsp; Since her 
								arrival to the Twin Cities, Karla has served as 
								a dance specialist for Perpich Center for Arts 
								Education’s ACE~Dance (Arts Courses for 
								Educators) and Multicultural Voices programs and 
								was an arts education coach for its ASAP (Arts &amp; 
								Schools As Partners) program. &nbsp;She also served 
								as a Teaching Artist and arts education coach 
								for Arts for Academic Achievement (MPS). &nbsp;She is 
								a 2013 recipient of the Excellence in 
								Educational Service Award (Ordway Center for 
								Performing Arts).&nbsp; She is currently a Teaching 
								Artist and a design team member for Ordway’s
